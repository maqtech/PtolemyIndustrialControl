<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p>
The following are known limitations and bugs that are not
sufficiently mission-critical to have been addressed.
<ol>

<li>
<b>Plot windows don't resize when control panel is resized</b>.
If a model with plotters
is executed using the run button on the toolbar, and
then re-executed using the run control panel accessed through
the View menu, then resizing the run control panel does not
cause the plots to resize to fit.
<b>Workaround</b>:
Close the model and re-open it, and then run first using the
run control panel.

<li>
<b>Control click and Mac OS X</b>.
