<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p>
The following are known limitations and bugs that are not
sufficiently mission-critical to have been addressed.
<ol>

<li>
<b>Applet limitations</b>
The GR applets do not work well under Java 1.5.0-beta.
Use 1.4.2-04 instead.

<li>
<b>JNI User interface problems</b>
The JNI User interface has problems creating new JNI models.
<b>If you follow the instructions in 
<a href="codeDoc/jni/JNIUtilities.html">JNIUtilities</a>, then
eventually you will get a NameDuplicationException.
<p>The resulting model will be missing
<pre>
&lt;property name="output" class="jni.Argument" value="false,false,true,double"&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>
We are working with the original authors on a solution.
<br>In the short term, one workaround is to edit the xml file directly
and add the appropriate property by hand.

<p>Another issue is the the JNI interface will not work wit
Hierarchical classes, subclasses, and inner classes.
<li>

<b>Matlab interface has problems work with gcc-3.3</b>
Under Windows, the Matlab interface has problems at runtime with gcc-3.3.
<br>Under Windows, we recommend using gcc-3.2.

<li>
<b>Copernicus does not work will if there are spaces in $PTII</b>
If Ptolemy is installed in a directory that has a space in the pathname,
then the Copernicus code generator does not work well.
<br>The problem is because Soot uses the StringTokenizer to process
options. The space character is a delimiter, which causes problems.

<li>
<b>Plot windows don't resize when control panel is resized</b>.
If a model with plotters
is executed using the run button on the toolbar, and
then re-executed using the run control panel accessed through
the View menu, then resizing the run control panel does not
cause the plots to resize to fit.
<b>Workaround</b>:
Close the model and re-open it, and then run first using the
run control panel.

<li>
<b>Control click and Mac OS X</b>.
