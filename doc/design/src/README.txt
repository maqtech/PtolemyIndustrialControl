To regenerate TOC and Index:

 1) Open the book file.
 2) Choose generate.
 3) Open the TOC file.
 4) Remove the silly page numbers for each "Part x" listing
 5) If you feel ambitious, open the index file and reduce the font
    size of all the page numbers --- frame is being really silly here...

(5) is not essential.
