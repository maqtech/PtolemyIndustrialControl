<h1>Ptolemy II</h1>
<P>

The Ptolemy project studies heterogeneous modeling and design of
concurrent systems. The focus is on embedded systems, particularly
those that mix technologies, including for example analog and digital
electronics, hardware and software, and electronics and mechanical
devices (including MEMS, microelectromechanical systems). The focus is
also on systems that are complex in the sense that they mix widely
different operations, such as signal processing, feedback control,
sequential decision making, and user interfaces.

<p>

Executable models are constructed under a model of computation, which
is the set of “laws of physics” that govern the interaction of
components in the model. If the model is describing a mechanical
system, then the model of computation may literally be the laws of
physics. More commonly, however, it is a set of rules that are more
abstract, and provide a framework within which a designer builds
models. A set of rules that govern the interaction of components is
called the semantics of the model of computation.

<p>

Ptolemy II is third-generation software. The objective is to support the
construction and interoperability of executable models that are built
under a wide variety of models of computation.  Ptolemy II is written
entirely in Java, and aims to support the construction of applets,
servlets, migrating code, and embedded Java.
