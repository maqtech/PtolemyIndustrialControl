<h1>Ptolemy II version 0.4 Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II version 0.4 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>This release is meant for programmers already familiar with Java.

 <p>Ptolemy II 0.4 includes applet demonstrations of the domains, but
it does not include a GUI.

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy 0.4, it can be found
in <a href="design/toc.htm" target="toc">$PTII/doc/design</a>.

The most recent copy of the Ptolemy II design document can be
found online at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html</CODE></a>


<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 0.4 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.2.

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 0.4 under Solaris 2.5.1 and NT4.0sp3 and later
with JDK1.2.2

<p> Ptolemy II 0.4 will not compile under JDK1.1.x.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite 

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<menu>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from <a
href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu</CODE></a>.

<li> Ptolemy II version 0.4 does not include a GUI.

<li> The JDK1.2.2 Plug-in has a bug that causes the Netscape or Iexplorer
process to linger after exiting.  The workaround is to turn of the JIT
using the Java Plug-in Control Panel, see the <a href="troubleshooting.htm#jit">Troubleshooting guide</a> for details.
