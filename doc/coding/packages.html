Ptolemy II uses the Java package system to group classes.

<menu>

<li> Bidirectional dependencies should be avoided.  If two packages
are dependent upon each other, it makes it hard to determine which
package to compile first.  Below are the possibilities
	<menu>
	<li> Remove the dependency
	<li> Combine the two packages into one package
	<li> Move the dependency into a third package, which
	will probably be a subpackage of one of the packages.
	</menu>

<li> A subpackage is a package that is beneath a parent package in the
directory hierarchy.  For example <CODE>pt.kernel.util</CODE> is a
subpackage of <CODE>pt.kernel</CODE>.  The makefiles are structured so
that we run make in the subdirectories first so in general, it is best
if parent packages depend on their subpackages.
