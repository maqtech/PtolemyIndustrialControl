<h1>Setting up a development tree</h1>
<HR>
This page describes how local developers setup parallel development trees.
The information below is primarily for use by developers at U.C. Berkeley.

<h2>Parallel trees</h2>
Locally, the master development tree is in <CODE>~ptII</CODE>.
The <a href="../../bin/ptlndir"><CODE>ptlndir</CODE></a> script
will create a parallel tree with links into the <CODE>~ptII</CODE> tree.
<pre>
mkdir ~/ptII
cd ptII
~ptII/bin/ptlndir ~ptII .
</pre>


<h2>Browsing you tree from the web</h2>
If you would like to be able to browse your development tree from the 
web, then you should set it up so that the development tree is
not publically available to anyone on the net.

<ol>
<li>  Create a directory for your private webpages:
<pre>
mkdir ~/public_html/private
</pre>

An alternative name is <CODE>~/public_html/local</CODE>

<li> Create a link to a <CODE>.htaccess</CODE> file that limits access:
<pre>
cd ~/public_html/private 
ln -s /usr/local/apache/htaccess/ohmCluster .htaccess
</pre>

<li>  Create any links you want from that directory.
<pre>
ln -s ~/ptII .
</pre>
</ol>
