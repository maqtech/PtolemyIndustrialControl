<h1>Ptolemy II version 0.3 Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II version 0.3 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>This release is meant for programmers already familiar with Java.

 <p>Ptolemy II 0.3 includes applet demonstrations of the domains, but
it does not include a GUI.

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy 0.3, it can be found
in <a href="design/toc.htm" target="toc">$PTII/doc/design</a>.

The most recent copy of the Ptolemy II design document can be
found online at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html</CODE></a>


<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 0.3 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.2.

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 0.3 under Solaris 2.5.1 and NT4.0sp3 
with JDK1.2.1

<p> Ptolemy II 0.3 will not compile under JDK1.1.x.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite 

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<menu>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from <a
href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu</CODE></a>.

<li> Ptolemy II version 0.3 does not include a GUI.

<li> <a name="fsm">This</a> release does not include the source code
to the Finite State Machine (FSM) domain.  At the time of the release,
the author of the FSM domain felt that it was not ready for publication.

Note that we include a jar
file of the fsm domain in the <code>$PTII/lib</code> directory for use
by a few of the Continuous Time demonstrations.

<li> The JDK1.2.1 Plug-in has a bug that causes the Netscape or Iexplorer
process to linger after exiting.  The workaround is to turn of the JIT
using the Java Plug-in Control Panel, see the <a href="troubleshooting.htm#jit">Troubleshooting guide</a> for details.
