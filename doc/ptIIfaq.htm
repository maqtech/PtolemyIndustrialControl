<dt> <a name="#ptolemy II description"><B>1.1 What is Ptolemy II?</B></a>
<dd> 
<p>
Ptolemy II is a software framework developed as part of the Ptolemy project.
It is a Java-based component assembly framework with a graphical
user interface called Vergil.  Vergil itself is a component assembly
defined in Ptolemy II.
</p>
<p>
The Ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of
concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. The focus is on assembly of
concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is
the use of well-defined <i>models of computation</i> that govern the
interactions between components. A major problem area being addressed is
the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/index.html" target="_top">Ptolemy Project web page</a>
contains much more information about the
project. The work is conducted in the
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_top">Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</a>
of the
<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_top">University of California at Berkeley</a>.
The project is directed by
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eal/index.html" target="_top">Prof. Edward Lee</a>.
The project is named after
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/people/ptolemy.htm" target="_top">Claudius Ptolemaeus</a>,
the second century Greek astronomer, mathematician, and geographer.

<dt> <a name="#ptolemy classic"><B>1.2 What about compatibility with Ptolemy Classic (Ptolemy 0.7.x)?</B></a>
<dd>
Ptolemy II and Ptolemy 0.x are two very different software systems.

Ptolemy 0.x is fairly mature software in that the design is stable and
mostly unchanging. The Ptolemy II software system is under active development.

<menu>
<li> They are written in different languages (Java vs. C++)

<li> They have different file formats. Ptolemy 0.x uses Octtools,
Ptolemy II uses a system based on XML

<li> They have different user interfaces.  The Ptolemy II UI
is much easier to use than the Ptolemy Classic UI.
<li> Ptolemy Classic works best under Unix.  There is a 
Windows port of Ptolemy Classic, but it does not work well.
<br>Ptolemy II works under both Unix and Windows.
<li> Ptolemy Classic can generate code for various DSP primarily
using SDF semantics.
<br> Ptolemy II can generate code for non-hierarchical SDF models
and for hierarchical Giotto models.

<DT> <A NAME="ptolemy II copyright"><B>1.3 What is the copyright?</B></A>
<DD> Ptolemy II is released under the fairly liberal UC Berkeley copyright,

see 
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptIIcopyright.htm"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptIIcopyright.htm</CODE></a>

Most files have the copyright at the top.

 <p>Ptplot is free for academic and commercial use.  You an incorporate it
into products, but you need to include follow the instructions in the
copyright notice.

 <p>This copyright is based on the Tcl copyright that was used when
Prof. Ousterhout was developing Tcl here at UC Berkeley.  This
copyright was also used in Ptolemy Classic, which has been used in
commercial products, see
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/archive/links.htm"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/archive/links.htm</CODE></a>

<DT> <A NAME="mailing list"><B>1.4 Is there a mailing list?</B></A>
<DD> 
The Ptolemy mailing lists are run by the Majordomo mailing list 
server.  This server can automatically subscribe you to mailing
lists and it can send you monthly archive files for each of the
lists.  To find out more about our Majordomo sever, send an email
letter to: majordomo@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu with the word "help"
in the body of the letter.

<dt> Ptolemy Interest Mailing list
<dd> This moderated mailing list is for Ptolemy announcements only. Thus,
you cannot post to this group.  The amount of mail here is kept very
light (a few messages a year).

 <p>To subscribe to the ptolemy-interest mailing list, send mail to:
ptolemy-interest-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu with the word
"subscribe" in the body (not the subject) of the letter.

 <p>All mail to ptolemy-interest also goes to ptolemy-hackers, so if you
subscribe to ptolemy-hackers, there is no need to subscribe to
ptolemy-interest too.


<dt>  Ptolemy Hackers Mailing list
<dd> This is a discussion list for Ptolemy questions, bug reports, and to
share Ptolemy additions and applications.  Since this is a discussion
group, mail volume can sometimes be heavy.  All mail sent to Ptolemy-
hackers is automatically cross posted to the comp.soft-sys.ptolemy
newsgroup.

 <p>To subscribe to the ptolemy-hackers mailing list, send mail to:
ptolemy-hackers-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu with the word 
"subscribe" in the body of the letter.  To leave the newsgroup put
the word "unsubscribe" in the body of your message.
</dl>

The best way to get questions answered is to subscribe to ptolemy-hackers
and then send email to that list.

 <p>Ptolemy is distributed without support or warranty.  However, if you
really need to contact a human being with a Ptolemy question, you can
send email to: ptolemy@eecs.berkeley.edu.

<dl>
<dt> <A NAME="downloading Ptolemy II"><B>2.1 How do I download	Ptolemy II?</B></A>
<dd> Ptolemy II is available in several formats including applets, source code, a Windows installer and Web Start. 
For details, see
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIlatest/"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIlatest/</CODE></a>

<dt> <A NAME="#platforms that Ptolemy II runs under"><B>2.2 What platforms does Ptolemy II run under?</B></A>
<dd> Ptolemy II is written in Java, so it should run on any platform
that supports a recent Java Virtual machine.  Locally, we use
Windows XP and Windows 2000 with the Cygwin toolkit for development.
The nightly builds run under Solaris 8.  Some people in the group use Linux.

<dl>
<dt> <A NAME="#ptolemy II installation, what do I need"><B>2.3 What do I need to Install Ptolemy II?</B></A>
<dd> At the minimum, you need the Java Runtime Environment.
