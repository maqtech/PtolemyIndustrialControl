<h1>Ptolemy II Quick Tour</h1>
<p>
Because of its open architecture and extensibility, Ptolemy II has
evolved a rich set of features.  By clicking on the links at the left,
you can get a quick overview of a few of these.
Some of the features are:
<ul>
<li> A block-diagram editor for building models.
<li> User interface utilities for applets and applications.
<li> Live editing of models and parameters;
<li> Network integration;
<li> A sophisticated type system including:
     <ul>
     <li> Type constraint propagation,
     <li> Record types,
     <li> Array types, and
     <li> Fixed-point type.
     </ul>
<li> An expression language for parameter expressions;
<li> Data-polymorphic component library;
<li> Domain-polymorphic component library;
<li> A polymorphic expression actor;
<li> A very simple XML file format called MoML;
<li> A flexible signal plotter;
<li> 3-D graphics animation infrastructure;
<li> Several domains with concurrent models of computation;
<li> A finite-state machine domain providing modal models;
<li> A continuous-time modeling domain;
<li> Hierarchically interoperable domains;
<li> On-line documentation (in HTML);
<li> Audio signal processing capabilities;
<li> Preliminary code generation capability;
</ul>
