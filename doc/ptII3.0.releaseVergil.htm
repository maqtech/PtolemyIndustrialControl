<h2>Limitations</h2>
Version 2.2 has a number of limitations.

<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<ul>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from 
ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.
 <p>Note further that some of the .class names are longer than
31 characters, which may cause problems when downloading zip files
on the Macintosh and using Stuffit.

<li> The documentation for custom actors used in demonstrations is not
included in the release.  The source code for the custom actors can be found
in the source download.

<li> If a URL ends with <CODE>#in_browser</CODE>, then
Ptolemy II will invoke the User's web browser.  Unfortunately, this
does not always work, especially under Windows if Netscape is already
running.  The workaround is to exit Netscape and let Ptolemy II
start up Netscape for you.


<li> Web Start does not work very well if the pathname to the 
<CODE>vergil.jnlp</CODE> file has spaces in it.  The workaround is
to place your Ptolemy II tree in a directory that does not have spaces
in the path name if you plan on using Web Start.

<li> Applet issues:
	<ul>

	<li> Opera has problems viewing applets that are on the local
	file system.  In particular, it seems to have problems with urls like
	<CODE>file:///d|/ptII/ptolemy/plot/demo/FourierSeries.htm</CODE>
	which work fine in Netscape 4.x, IE, Mozilla.

	 <p>However, if I use the following style of URL, then some of the applets
	work: 
<CODE>file://localhost/d:/ptII/ptolemy/plot/demo/FourierSeries.htm</CODE>.
	Unfortunately any applet that accesses a data file will
	not work with the above URL style because the data file will
	be outside the codebase.

	 <p> The solution is to install a web server on the local
	machine and view the applets using 
	<CODE>http://localhost/</CODE>
	
        <li> Opera 6.03/Windows 2000/Java 1.4.0, may have
        problems running applets that include diva.jar if diva.jar
	is not downloaded in the first applet.  To reproduce this problem:
	<ol>
	<li> Run <a href="../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Butterfly/Butterfly.htm">SDF Butterfly</a>, which does not use diva.jar

	<li> <a href="../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Expression/Expression.htm">SDF Expression</a>, which uses diva.jar

	<li> In Opera, do <CODE>Window</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Special</CODE>
	-&gt; <CODE>Java Console</CODE>, and you will see the following
        stack trace
<pre>
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: diva/graph/GraphController

at opera.PluginPanel.run(opera/PluginPanel.java:343) 
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:536)  
</pre>

	</ol>
	The problem only occurs under Opera.

	<li> The DDE Zeno demo produces an error message in the Java Plug-in
	console window:
<pre>
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: LowerJoin - Attempt to set current time
	      to the past; time = 50.001. The _lastTime was 54.0

</pre>

	<li> Running the Networked demo via an applet on the local
	file system results in an AccessControlException.
<pre>
com.microstar.xml.XmlException: XML element "entity" triggers exception:
  java.lang.Exception: Attempted to lookup 'Waveform', but got: 
  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Waveform
Attempted to find as a moml class, but got:

</pre>

	The Network demo does not work as a local applet because the xml file
	includes a reference to http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu, which is
	not on the local file system, so we get a SecurityException.
	 <br>The workaround is to run the applet by downloading it
	from the Ptolemy Website:
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII2.2/ptII2.2/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII2.2/ptII2.2/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm</CODE></a>
	</ul>

<li> Web Start issues:
	<ul>

	<li> Viewing a pdf file may bring up a blank window along with
	the pdf file.  Running the code generator may bring up
	a blank window while the java or javac processes are running.

	<li> Web Start is limited to about 65Mb of memory
	 <br>If you try to run all the demos, then eventually you may
	see the following in the Web Start console
<pre>
761 ms. Memory: 65280K Free: 3614K (6%)
7471 ms. Memory: 65280K Free: 931K (1%)
Exception occurred during event dispatching:
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

	&lt;&lt;no stack trace available&gt;&gt;
</pre>
	One workaround is to request garbage collection by doing
	<CODE>File</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>View</CODE> -&gt;
	<CODE>JVM Properties</CODE> -&gt;
	<CODE>Request Garbage Collection</CODE>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li>The actor library is far from complete.
<li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
expressions of double-valued inputs.

<li> The Ptolemy parameter parser uses comma "," to separate elements
in an array.  This causes problems when Ptolemy is run on
European machines that use a comma "1,0" instead of a period "1.1"
in floating point numbers.

<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

<!-- If you change the next paragraph update install.htm -->

<li>The Matlab interface works only under Windows and it requires that
Matlab be installed on the local machine. 
The Matlab interface should work with version of Matlab from
R11 (5.3) and up to and including R12.1 (6.1)
<p>Didier Mauuary reports that under Windows 98, configure failed
to set up the <code>MATLAB_DIR</code>, <code>PTCC</code>
and <code>PTDLLTOOL</code> makefile variables, but after
he set them by hand:
<pre>
 MATLAB_DIR = /cygdrive/c/MATLABR11
 PTCC = gcc
 PTDLLTOOL = dlltool
</pre>
he was able to get farther with the recompilation of the Matlab interface.

<li> The actor.lib.comm.SerialComm actor requires that Javacomm is installed

<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html</CODE></a>.
The SerialComm actor will only work under Windows.

</ul>

<h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.


<h3>Limitations in the TM Domain</h3>
The TM domain will not run in system that does not have a GUI because
the TMDirector brings up a plot of the schedule.

<h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>

Below are some of the limitations of Vergil, the Ptolemy II Graphical
User Interface.

<ul>

<li> Under JDK1.3.1_03, the tool tips do not work.  They work under
JDK1.3.1_02, see 
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4671567.html"><CODE>http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4671567.html</CODE></a>.


<li> When setting the type of a port, we should provide a combo
box that lists the common ports

<li> When creating a Modal Model, use Control-Right-Button to
drawn arcs between nodes.  One potential workaround would
be to have an information message in the status bar about this.

<li> You should not change the names of built in ports - The port
mechanism should disallow port name changes on ports that are
named in Java.  The UI could recognize this.  The UI should
not allow the user to remove built in Java defined ports.
<li> Query needs to be put into a scroll pane
<li> Manually setting of the types of actors like ArrayToSequence that
have constraints on their element types can cause problems.
<li> HTVQ demo is badly laid out when run under vergil.
<li>No undo mechanism.
<li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
<li>It is difficult to control wire routing.
<li>Cannot have more than one vertex in a connection.
<li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.
<li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
<li>Icon editor not yet integrated.
<li>Debugger not yet integrated.
<li>It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.
<li>No dynamic class reloading.
</ul>

<h3>Code Generation Limitations</h3>
Code Generation limitations are covered on the
<a href="codegen.htm#limitations">Code Generation</a> page. 

<h3>Missing Domains</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boolean and integer dataflow.
<li>Dynamic dataflow
