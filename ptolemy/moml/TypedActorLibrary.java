/**
A hierarchical library of components specified in MoML.  The contents are
specified via the configure() method.  The MoML is evaluated
lazily; i.e. it is not actually evaluated until there is a request
for its contents, via a call to getEntity(), numEntities(),
entityList(), or any related method. You can also force evaluation
of the MoML by calling populate().  This object contains an
attribute of class LibraryMarkerAttribute, to mark it as a library.
<p>
The configure method can be given a URL or MoML text or both.
If it is given MoML text, that text will normally be wrapped in a
processing instruction, as follows:
<pre>
   &lt;?moml
     <group>
     ... <i>MoML elements giving library contents</i> ...
     </group>
   ?&gt;
</pre>
The processing instruction, which is enclosed in "&lt;?" and "?&gt"
prevents premature evaluation of the MoML.  The processing instruction
has a <i>target</i>, "moml", which specifies that it contains MoML code.
The keyword "moml" in the processing instruction must
be exactly as above, or the entire processing instruction will
be ignored.  The populate() method
strips off the processing instruction and evaluates the MoML elements.  
The group element allows the library contents to be given as a set
of elements (the MoML parser requires that there always be a single
top-level element, which in this case will be the group element).
<p>
One subtlety in using this class arises because of a problem typical
of lazy evaluation.  A number of exceptions may be thrown because of
errors in the MoML code when the MoML code is evaluated.  However,
since that code is evaluated lazily, it is evaluated in a context
where these exceptions are not expected.  There is no completely
clean solution to this problem; our solution is to translate all
exceptions to runtime exceptions in the populate() method.
This method, therefore, violates the condition for using runtime
exceptions in that the condition that causes these exceptions to
be thrown is not a testable precondition.
