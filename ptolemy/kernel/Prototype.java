/**
   An Prototype is a named object that can be either a class definition
   or not.  If it is a class definition, then "instances" of that class
   definition can be created by the instantiate() method.
   It supports a deferral and propagation mechanism. That is, changes
   to the prototype propagate automatically to "instances" that
   were created from the prototype.
