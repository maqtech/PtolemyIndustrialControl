/** PtolemyThread
PtolemyThread extends Thread by adding a <i>readDepth</i> field. This field is
used for counting the number of read accesses this thread has gotten from the
workspace.
<p>
In general, if a thread will ever need a read or write access from the
workspace (by calling the getReadAccess() or getWriteAccess() method) then
it should use the PtolemyThread class. One advantage is that it provides a
more efficient access to the readDepth field, as otherwise the workspace has
to store the readDepth fields for the thread in a hash table.
<p>
For flexibility, one can still use the reader-writer mechanism in the Workspace
class just by using the Thread class. Obviously, some efficiency will be lost
as the workspace has to store and then search the readDepth fields in a hash
table. (as was mentioned in the previous paragraph)
