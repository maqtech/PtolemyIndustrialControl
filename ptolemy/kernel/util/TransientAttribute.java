This class is a nonpersistent configurable singleton attribute.
By "nonpersistent" we mean that it does not export MoML.
A major application of this class is to define a default icon
description.  An icon description is XML code in the SVG
(scalable vector graphics) schema, set in a configure element
in MoML.
