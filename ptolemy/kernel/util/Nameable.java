/**
This is an interface for objects with a name and a container. A simple
name is an arbitrary string that identifies the object in the context of
its container. In addition, the interface supports a
"full name" which in implementation should identify both the container
and the individual object. The implementations in the kernel package
define the full name of an object to be the full name of its container
followed by a period followed by the simple name of the object.
Given the implementations of this interface in the kernel
package, it is not a good idea to have periods or braces in the name,
although this is not enforced.  Braces will make it difficult to parse
the descriptions returned by the description() method.
