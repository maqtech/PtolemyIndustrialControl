/** Thrown on an attempt to add a named object to a collection that
requires unique names, and finding that there already is an object
by that name in the collection.
Constructors are provided that take 1 or 2 Nameable references
plus an arbitrary String.  The constructors are robust in that null
references are ignored.  The preferred constructors are those that
take two named objects (the container and the would-be containee),
or two named objects and an arbitrary string (which can be used to
provide additional information about the error).
