//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Instantiable
/**
   This interface is for objects that can be instantiated.  Such objects serve a
   role similar to "classes" in Java and other object oriented languages,
   but function more as prototypes than classes. They are ordinary Ptolemy II
   objects, but whose purpose is to serve as a factory for instances that
   are clones of themselves.  Normally, they play no role in the execution
   of a model.
   <p>
   An object that implements this interface can be in one of two states.
   Either it is a class definition (isClassDefinition() returns true)
   or it is not.  Only objects that are class definitions can be instantiated.
   (They are said to be "fertile").  Objects that are class definitions
   are expected to be ignored by the execution engine of a model.
