/**
This is an interface for attributes that can have their values
externally set.  An attribute class that implements this interface has to
be able to have a value set by a string, via the setExpression()
method.  A string representation is returned by the getExpression()
method.  An expression may be an ordinary string with no further
interpretation, or it may be a string that needs to be evaluated.
In the latter case, an implementation of this attribute may not
evaluate the string when the setExpression() method is called.
It may instead only evaluate the string when the validate() method
is called.  Often this will not be called until the value of the
expression is actually needed (this is known as "lazy evaluation").
Such an implementation will defer notification of listeners and the
container until the string is evaluated. In a typical use of this
interface, therefore, it is necessary to be sure that validate()
is called sometime after setExpression() is called.
<p>
In addition, an attribute class that implements this interface
needs to maintain a list of listeners that are informed whenever
the value of the attribute changes.  It should inform those
listeners whenever setExpression() is called.
<p>
Among other uses, this interface marks attributes whose value
can be set via the value attribute of a MoML property element.
For example, if class XXX implements Settable, then the following
is valid MoML:
<pre>
  &lt;property name="xxx" class="XXX" value="yyy"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This interface also supports annotations that hint to a user
interface the level of visibility that an instance should have.
The visibility is specified as one of the static instances of
the inner class Visibility, currently NONE, EXPERT and FULL.
NONE indicates that the user should never see the instance,
and should not be able to set its value through the user interface.
EXPERT means that only expert users should see the instance.
FULL means that the instance is always visible, and a user interface
should always allow it to be set.
