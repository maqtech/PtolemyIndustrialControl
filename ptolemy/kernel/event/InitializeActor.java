/**
A request to initialize an actor.  This class is used for certain
kinds of mutations where the actor can be created directly (not via
a queued mutation), but the initialization of the actor must be
deferred so that it executes at an appropriate time.  Note that
many domain will tolerate the creation of an actor at any time,
and as long as the actor is not connected to any pre-existing actor,
the director will ignore it.
