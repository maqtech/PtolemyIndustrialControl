<H2>The changes between ptplot1.1 and ptplot1.2</H2>
<MENU>
<LI> Added support for JAR files

<LI> Added <A HREF="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Ptplot</A>
and <A HREF="ptplotfaq.html">Ptplot FAQ</A>.
</MENU>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.0 and ptplot1.1</H2>
<MENU>
<LI> In 1.1, PlotBox extends Panel.  In 1.0 PlotBox extended Applet.
This makes it much easier to use Plot as an component in either an
application or an applet that contains other components.
<LI> The PlotApplet class is new in 1.1.  PlotApplet can be used 
for applets that use the Plot class, or the PlotLive class.
As a result, the html applet tags for the demos now use
<CODE>code="ptplot.PlotApplet"</CODE>.
Formerly, they used 
<CODE>code="ptplot.Plot"</CODE>
<LI> The directory structure has been reorganized so that
the plot classes are in ptplot, and the demo classes are in
<A HREF="../../demo"><CODE>ptplot/demo</CODE></A>.
This means that the ptplot.zip does not contain the demo
classes, which is better if anyone actually wants to _use_ the plotter
instead of just running the demos.
<LI> There is a <A HREF="../../demo/audio/PlayingWave.html">Playing Wave
Applet</A> that uses real time audio.
<LI> Edward Lee fixed a bar graph label bug reported by Marc Ellis.
<LI> A few other minor bugs were fixed.
