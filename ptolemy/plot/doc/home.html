<h2>Description</h2>
This is a set of two dimensional signal plotters components
written in Java with the following properties:
<ul>
<li> Embeddable in applets or applications.
<li> Binary or ASCII data.
<li> Auto-ranging.
<li> Automatic or manual labeling of axes.
<li> Automatic or manual tick marks.
<li> Logarithmic axes.
<li> Live, animated plots.
<li> Infinite zooming.
<li> Various plot styles: connected lines, scatter plot, bars, etc.
<li> Various point styles: none, dots, points, and unique marks.
<li> Multiple data sets and a legend.
<li> Color or black and white plotting.
<li> Error bars.
</ul>

The applet implementation can read data to plot from a URL or
construct the data in custom Java code.  One of the supplied
application classes can read data from a URL and use command-line
arguments to format the plot.  The command-line arguments are
compatible with the popular Unix signal plotter <CODE>xgraph</CODE>.

<p>There is a set of <a href="../demo/toc.html" target="contents">demonstrations</a>
of these classes.
The main class implementing the plotter component is 
<a href="../Plot.java">Plot</a>.  It is derived from 
<a href="../PlotBox.java">PlotBox</a>, which provides only the axes and
decorations of the plot.  This is implemented in a base class so that
it can be reused for different kinds of plots.  Live (animated) data
plots are supported by the <a href="../PlotLive.java">PlotLive</a> class.
This class is abstract; a derived class must be created to generate
the data to plot (or collect it from some other application).  <p>

 <p><a href="../demo/TwoPlotExample.java">TwoPlotExample</CODE></a>
is a very simple sample Ptplot application.

 <p>A more complex application is implemented by the
<a href="../PlotApplication.java">PlotApplication</a> class.
The PlotApplication class
includes support for printing and generating HTML for use with the
Plot applet.  The <a href="../ptplot"><CODE>ptplot</CODE></a>
shell script starts up PlotApplication from a Unix
shell prompt.

 <p>Backward compatibility with the C <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> program
is provided by the 
<a href="../Pxgraph.java">Pxgraph</a> class.

 <P><A NAME="xgraph">This</A> code owes a heavy debt to David
Harrison, the original author of <CODE>xgraph</CODE>, which runs under
the X window system on Unix platforms.  An extension to
<CODE>xgraph</CODE> called <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>, written by Joe Buck,
reads binary files as well as ASCII.  For compatibility with these
programs, we have provided a Bourne Shell script called
<CODE>pxgraph</CODE> that is a drop-in replacement for either
<CODE>xgraph</CODE> or <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>.  Unlike the original
program, however, the Java implementation does not depend on the X
window system.  We have provided a DOS batch file called
<CODE>pxgraph.bat</CODE> that brings <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> capability
to Windows platforms.
