<hr>
An example of a bar graph:
<p>
<applet name="BarGraph" code="plot.Plot" width=500 height=400
    codebase="../.."
    archive="plot/plot.zip"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="dataurl" value="bargraph.plt">
    <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Here,  data is read from a <a href="bargraph.plt">URL</a>.
The horizontal axis is manually labeled with tick marks indicating years.
It is possible to control the thickness of bars and the offset of the bars
behind by editing that file.
