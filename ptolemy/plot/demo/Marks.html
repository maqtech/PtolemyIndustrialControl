<h1>Plot data read from a URL</h1>
<hr>
The plot below obtains its data from a
<a href="data.plt">data file</a> at a URL and shows certain features
of the plotter:
<p>
<applet code="Plot.class" width=500 height=400
    codebase=".."
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
<param name="dataurl" value="data.plt">
   <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Note that color is disabled, and individual marks
are used for the first ten data sets.  After that, the marks are recycled,
so the eleventh data set is indistinguishable from the first.
Also note that the first two data sets are connected with lines,
but the remaining data sets are not.
The ranges for the horizontal and vertical axes are computed automatically from
the data, but the tick marks for the horizontal axis are specified explicitly.
This is why they appear as words rather than numbers.
Note that each axis and each data set is labeled by a string given in the data file.
