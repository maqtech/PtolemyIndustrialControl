//// Workspace
/**
An instance of Workspace is used for synchronization and version tracking
of interdependent groups of objects.  These objects are said to be in the
workspace. This is not the same as the <i>container</i> association
in Ptolemy II.  A workspace is never returned by a getContainer() method.
<p>
The workspace provides a rudimentary directory service that can
be used to keep track of the objects within it.  It is not required to use
it in order to use the workspace for synchronization. Items are added
to the directory by calling add().
The names of the items in the directory are not required to be unique.
<p>
When reading the state of objects in the workspace, a thread must
ensure that no other thread is simultaneously modifying the objects in the
workspace.  To read-synchronize on its workspace, it uses the following
code in a method:
<pre>
    try {
	_workspace.getReadAccess();
	// ... code that reads
    } finally {
	_workspace.doneReading();
    }
</pre>
We assume that the _workspace variable references the workspace, as for example
in the NamedObj class. The getReadAccess() method suspends the thread if
another thread is currently modifying the workspace, and otherwise
returns immediately. Note that multiple readers can simultaneously have
read access. The finally clause is executed even if
an exception occurs.  This is essential because without the call
to doneReading(), the workspace will never again allow any thread
to modify it.  It believes there is still a thread reading it.
Any number of threads can simultaneously read the workspace.
<p>
To make changes in the workspace, a thread must write-synchronize
using the following code:
<pre>
    try {
	_workspace.getWriteAccess();
	// ... code that writes
    } finally {
	_workspace.doneWriting();
    }
</pre>
Only one thread can be writing to the workspace at a time, and
while the write permission is held, no thread can read the workspace.
Again, the call to doneWriting() is essential, or the workspace
will remain permanently locked to either reading or writing.
<p>
Note that it is not necessary to obtain a write lock just to add
an item to the workspace directory.  The methods for accessing
the directory are all synchronized, so there is no risk of any
thread reading an inconsistent state.
<p>
To improve performance, one can use the PtolemyThread class instead of the
ordinary Thread class. The improvement is gained by having PtolemyThread
object includes an integer field to store the read depth. This is as opposed
to using a hashtable as a map between (ordinary )Thread object and its
read depth field.
<p>
Workspace can be made read-only by calling the setReadOnly(boolean)
method with <i>true</i> as an argument. A read-only workspace can only have
readers but no writers. The getReadAccess() and doneReading() methods invoked
on a read-only workspace return immediately bypassing all checks. Note that
the pairing of the getReadAccess() and doneReading() methods is not checked
under this condition. The getWriteAccess() and doneWriting() methods invoked
on a read-only workspace will throw an exception. This is done to improve
performance, as in many cases there are certain parts of simulation where
we can predict in advance that no write access will be needed.
