//// RelationList

/**
 A RelationList object contains a list of relations of a guard expression.
 It provides facilities to access the previous and current information of
 each relation of a guard expression during its evaluation. The information
 includes relation type and the difference information. (See
 {@link ParseTreeEvaluatorForGuardExpression} for the detailed explanation
 of relation type and difference.) This attribute is non-persistent and will
 not be exported into MoML.
 <p>
 This class is designed to be used with ParseTreeEvaluatorForGuardExpression.
 The common usage would be like:
 <p>
 <i>Construct a relation list for a transition with the first argument of the
 constructor as that transition.</i>
 <pre>
 _relationList = new RelationList(this, "relationList");
 </pre>
 <p>
 <i>Associate the relation list with the an object of
 ParseTreeEvaluatorForGuardExpression</i>
 <pre>
 _parseTreeEvaluator =
 new ParseTreeEvaluatorForGuardExpression(_relationList);
 </pre>
 <p>
 See {@link Transition} for the detailed usage.
