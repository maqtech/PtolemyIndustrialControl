//// HDFFSMState
/**
A HDFFSMState is a state in an FSM that refines a heterochronous
dataflow (HDF) actor. An HDFFSMState must be used instead of an FSMState
when the FSM refines a HDF actor. It must be refined by a subsystem
which is an opaque composite actor. The association between this state
and the opaque composite actor representing the subsystem is established
by calling setRefinement().
<p>
Note that instances of HDFFSMState must be contained by an 
HDFFSMController actor and that instances of the associated
refining states (an opaque composite actor) must be contained
by the HDF actor that this FSM refines. A HDF actor refining to an FSM
should therefore contain an HDFFSMController (containing only
instances of HDFFSMState and HDFFSMTransition), an HDFFSMDirector,
and an opaque composite actor (the refining subsystem) for each
state in the FSM. Each refining subsystem must refine to either
another FSM, an SDF diagram, or an HDF diagram. There is no
constraint to the number of levels in the hierarchy.
