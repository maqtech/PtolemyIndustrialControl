//// Action
/**
An Action is contained by a Transition in an FSMActor.
<p>
When the FSMActor is fired, an enabled transition among the outgoing
transitions of the current state is chosen. The choice actions
contained by the chosen transition are executed. An action is a choice
action if it implements the ChoiceAction marker interface. A choice
action may be executed more than once during an iteration in domains
with fixed-point semantics.
<p>
When the FSMActor is postfired, the chosen transition of the latest firing
of the actor is committed. The commit actions contained by the transition
are executed and the current state of the actor is set to the destination
state of the transition. An action is a commit action if it implements the
CommitAction marker interface.
<p>
An action creates a variable in the transition containing the action. The
variable can be used by derived classes for expression evaluation. The name
of the variable is obtained by prepending an underscore to the name of the
action. The scope of the variable includes all the variables and parameters
in the FSMActor containing the transition that contains the action.
