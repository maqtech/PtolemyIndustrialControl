/**
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue receiver with variable capacity and
optional history. Tokens are put into the receiver with the put() method,
and removed from the receiver with the get() method. The token removed is
the oldest one in the receiver. By default, the capacity is unbounded, but
it can be set to any nonnegative size. If the history capacity is greater
than zero (or infinite, indicated by a capacity of INFINITE_CAPACITY),
then tokens removed from the receiver are stored in a history queue rather
than simply removed. By default, the history capacity is zero.
