/**
<h1>SDF overview</h1>
The Synchronous Dataflow(SDF) domain supports the efficient
execution of Dataflow graphs that
lack control structures.   Dataflow graphs that contain control structures
should be executed using the Process Networks(PN) domain instead.
SDF allows efficient execution, with very little overhead at runtime.  It
requires that the rates on the ports of all actors be known before hand.
SDF also requires that the rates on the ports not change during
execution.  In addition, in some cases (namely systems with feedback) delays,
which are represented by initial tokens on relations must be explicitly
noted.  SDF uses this rate and delay information to determine
the execution sequence of the actors before execution begins.
<h2>Schedule Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>The number of tokens accumulated on every relation is bounded, given
an infinite number of executions of the schedule.
<li>Deadlock will never occur, given an infinite number of executions of
the schedule.
</ul>
<h1>Class comments</h1>
An SDFDirector is the class that controls execution of actors under the
SDF domain.  By default, actor scheduling is handled by the SDFScheduler
class.  Furthermore, the newReceiver method creates Receivers of type
SDFReceiver, which extends QueueReceiver to support optimized gets
and puts of arrays of tokens.
<p>
Actors are assumed to consume and produce exactly one token per channel on
each firing.  Actors that do not follow this convention should set
the appropriate parameters on input and output ports to declare the number
of tokens they produce or consume.  See the
@link ptolemy.domains.sdf.kernel.SDFScheduler for more information.
The @link ptolemy.domains.sdf.lib.SampleDelay actor is usually used
in a model to specify the delay across a relation.
<p>
The <i>allowDisconnectedGraphs</i> parameter of this director determines
whether disconnected graphs are permitted.
A model may have two or more graphs of actors that
are not connected.  The schedule can jump from one graph to
another among the disconnected graphs. There is nothing to
force the scheduler to finish executing all actors on one
graph before firing actors on another graph. However, the
order of execution within an graph should be correct.
Usually, disconnected graphs in an SDF model indicates an
error.
The default value of the allowDisconnectedGraphs parameter is a
BooleanToken with the value false.
<p>
The <i>iterations</i> parameter of this director corresponds to a
limit on the number of times the director will fire its hierarchy
before it returns false in postfire.  If this number is not greater
than zero, then no limit is set and postfire will always return true.
The default value of the iterations parameter is an IntToken with value zero.
<p>
The <i>vectorizationFactor</i> parameter of this director sets the number
of times that the basic schedule is executed during each firing of this
director.  This might allow the director to execute the model more efficiently,
by combining multiple firings of each actor.  The default value of the
vectorizationFactor parameter is an IntToken with value one.
