This demo application was written for the early access implementation of
Sun's Java Sound API. To compile, edit the makefile to point to the
location of sound.jar in the Java Sound installation. To run, edit
runapp_solaris if using Solaris or runapp_windows.bat if using Windows.

The demo can then be run by typing:
./runapp_solaris AudioSourceDemo

or

./runapp_windows.bat AudioSourceDemo

To specify a sound file to read in, change the AudioSource pathName
parameter in AudioSourceDemo.java to point to a different URL or a
file on the local filesystem.
