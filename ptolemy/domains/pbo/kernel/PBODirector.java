/**
This class implements the Port-based object model of computation.
This model of computation is not data driven, like most of the other
ptolemy domains.  Instead, it relies on analysis and user tuning of the
scheduling to ensure that no important data is lost (or that lost data is
not critical to the execution of the system).  This gives good real-time
performance, and this model of computation is often used in embedded control
systems.
<p>
Communication between port-based objects is *NOT* based on FIFO queues!
Instead, the processes have a concept of a shared memory.   The shared
memory is synchronized across processes that may be executing concurrently,
so that an object is always guaranteed to have the most recent consistent
available state of its inputs when it fires.   Note that in this communication
model, data may be lost!
<p>
Port-based objects are normally associated with independant processes.
However,
unlike Process Networks, the threads are time-driven, instead of data-driven.
Each actor has an associated firing period, which determines how often
it will execute.  When a process is scheduled, it reads the current state
of its input ports, performs calculation, and then sets the state of its
output ports.   Because of this model, the calculated output during any
firing is dependant on the arrival of events, which results in
non-deterministic output.  Some effort must be expended at some point in the
design of a system using this domain in properly choosing the firing
periods of each actor.
<p>
Instead of associating a process with each actor, this director manually
schedules the actors.  This can be useful for simulating execution on
a target architecture that is different from the development machine.  In the
future, a director based on actor/process could be developed that would allow
the fastest execution on a given architecture.
<p>
The scheduling of actors is purposefully handled in an informal way.  Each
actor specifies the period between firings using its
<i>executionPeriod</i> parameter.  The
scheduler attempts to fire the actor every time that period expires.
The time spent during firing of the actor is given by its <i>executionTime</i>
parameter.
<p>
This director schedules each process using a non-preemptive
earliest deadline first strategy.
Note that this means the currentTime of the director will advance
by the <i>executionTime</i> parameter of an actor when the actor is fired.
This is not the optimal strategy in terms of processor utilization, but it
is deterministic and very much simpler than trying to deal with preeemptive
modeling.  In such a case priority scheduling of some kind is
probably necessary.
<p>
This director maintains a calendar queue of all the actors in the
simulation, and fires them in the order given by the queue.  This director
creates receivers of class PBOReceiver, which implements the shared memory
communication.
