/**
A RcvrTimeTriple is a data structure for storing a receiver along with its 
rcvrTime and priority. RcvrTimeTriples are used by ODActors to order
incoming events according to time stamps. Each ODActor has a RcvrTimeTriple
associated with each receiver it owns. In situations where multiple 
receivers of an ODActor have simultaneous events, the priority of the
RcvrTimeTriples are used to determine order.
