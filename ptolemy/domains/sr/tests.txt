Latch is failing, TriggeredTime is failing - because Distributor changes
output channels on each firing - or is it something else?

need to test two constants feeding into an adder, with different firing orders


kernel tests:

*OrCyclic - true is fed into a logical or, and the result is complemented and 
fed back into the logical or (all values should converge).

*OrCyclicUndefined - false is fed into a logical or, and the result is 
complemented and fed back into the logical or (some values should remain 
unknown).

PulseOr - a logical or is performed on tokens from two pulses

PulseSum - tokens from two pulses are added together

RampDoublePeriod - tokens from a ramp are squared (the period of the director 
is a double)

RampFiringLimit - tokens from two ramps are added together (one has a firing 
limit)

RampIntPeriod - tokens from a ramp are squared (the period of the director is 
an int)

Ramps - tokens from two ramps are added together

RampSwitch - tokens from two ramps feed into a switch


lib tests:

*Delay - tokens from a ramp are delayed by either 0, 1, or 2 instants (need 
to test for "no token")

*Latch - tokens from a ramp are distributed to three channels, and the tokens 
are latched (need to test for "no token")

*TriggeredTime - tokens from a ramp are distributed to three channels, which 
trigger the TriggeredTime actor (need to test for "no token")
