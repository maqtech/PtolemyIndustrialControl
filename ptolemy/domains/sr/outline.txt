Introduction
     motivation for SR
         instantaneous feedback
         instantaneous dialog
SR Semantics
     untimed domain (inherited from outside director)
     many possible valid schedules
            can handle disconnected graphs
            can handle cyclic graphs (instantaneous feedback and dialog)
     actor prefire() monotonicity assumption
     actor output monotonicity constraint
     nonstrict actors
SR Implementation
     receiver
     randomized and optimized schedulers
     director
         nonstrict actors
SR Actors
     specialized actors
SR Execution
     simple examples
     hierarchical models
         SR embedded in SR
         SR embedded in other domains and other domains embedded in SR
     more complex demos
