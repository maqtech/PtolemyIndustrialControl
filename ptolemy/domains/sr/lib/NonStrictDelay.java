/**
This actor implements a token delay.  It has one input port and
one output port, both of which are single ports.  A token that is received
on the input port is sent on the output port on the next iteration.  If more
than one token is received on the input port in a given iteration, only
the final token is output on the next iteration.  If no tokens are received
in a given iteration, no token is output on the next iteration.
