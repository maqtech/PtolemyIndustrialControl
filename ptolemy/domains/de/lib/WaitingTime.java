//// WaitingTime
/**
This actor measures the time that events at one input have to wait for
events at another.  Specifically, there will be one output event for
each <i>waiter</i> input event.  But the output event is delayed until the
next arrival of an event at <i>waitee</i>.  When one or more events arrive
at <i>waitee</i>, then all events that have arrived at <i>waiter</i> since
the last <i>waitee</i> (or since the start of the execution) trigger an
output.  The value of each output is the time that the <i>waiter</i> event
waited for <i>waitee</i>.  The inputs are of type Token, so anything
is acceptable.  The output is always a DoubleToken.
