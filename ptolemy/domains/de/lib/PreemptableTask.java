//// PreemptableTask
/**
This actor implements a preemptable task.  The <i>executionTime</i>
parameter specifies the time it takes to execute the task.  When a
token is received on the <i>input</i> port, the token is stored in the
actor and the actor is scheduled to fire at <i>executionTime</i> time
units later.  When the <i>interrupt</i> port receives a token, and the
value is true, this task is "preempted."  Later, when the value of the
token on the <i>interrupt</i> port becomes false, the elapsed time is
calculated and added to the execution time of the task.  The actor is
scheduled to fire at this new execution time.  The saved token is
emitted when the new execution time has passed.  Subsequent input
tokens are queued until the actor is done processing the current input
token.

<p>This method of queueing tokens inside of the actor results in a
cleaner design that queuing tokens in the receiver.  Queueing tokens
in the receiver requires keeping track of the many states that result
from the interaction between tokens on the input ports and whether the
actor is currently executing a task or is currently interrupted.
