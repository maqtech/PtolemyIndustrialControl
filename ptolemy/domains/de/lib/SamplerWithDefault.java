//// SamplerWithDefault
/**
Output the most recent input token when the <i>trigger</i> port
receives a token.  If no token has been received on the <i>input</i>
port when a token is received on the <i>trigger</i> port, then the
value of the <i>initialValue</i> parameter is produced.  The inputs
can be of any token type, and the output is constrained to be of a
type at least that of the input and the parameter.

<p> Both the <i>input</i> port and the
<i>output</i> port are multiports.  Generally, their widths should
match. Otherwise, if the width of the <i>input</i> is greater than the
width of the <i>output</i>, the extra input tokens will not appear on
any output, although they will be consumed from the input port. If the
width of the <i>output</i> is greater than that of the <i>input</i>,
then the last few channels of the <i>output</i> will never emit
tokens. 

<p> Note: If the width of the input changes during
execution, then the most recent inputs are forgotten, as if the
execution of the model were starting over.  

<p> This actor differs
from the Sampler actor in how it handles the initial condition.  If
the initial conditions are not too critical (if, for instance, the
first event to this actor is an <i>input</i> rather than a
<i>trigger</i>) then it is easier to use the Sampler actor, since no
properly typed initial value need be specified.
