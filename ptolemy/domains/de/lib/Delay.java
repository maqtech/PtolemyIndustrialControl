//// Delay
/**
This actor delays the input by a specified amount of time.
The time delay is required to be non-negative and has default value 1.0.
The input and output types are unconstrained, except that the
output type must be at least that of the input.
<p>
The behavior on each firing is to read a token from the input,
if there is one, and to produce the token on the corresponding output
channel with the appropriate time delay.  The output is produced
in the postfire() method, consistent with the notion that persistent
state is only updated in postfire().  Notice that it produces
the output immediately, in the same iteration that it reads the
input, so that even if the actor no longer exists
after the time delay elapses, the destination actor will still see
the token. If there is no input token, then no output token is
produced.
<p>
Occasionally, it is useful to set the time
delay to zero.  This causes the input tokens to be produced on
the output immediately.  However, since the actor declares that
there is a delay between the input and the output, the DE director
will assume there is a delay when determining the precedences of the
actors.  Moreover, the event is queued to be processed in the next
microstep, after all events at the current time with the current
microstep. Thus, it is sometimes useful to think of this zero-valued
delay as an infinitesimal delay.
