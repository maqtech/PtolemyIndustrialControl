/**
This is a timed merge actor, which merges a set of input signals into
a single output signal.  It has an input port
(a multiport) and an output port (a single port).
The types of the ports are undeclared and will be resolved by the type
resolution mechanism, with the constraint that the output type must be
greater than or equal to the input type. On each call to the fire method, the
actor reads all available tokens from each input channel and sends
them to the output port. In DE, all tokens read in one invocation of the
fire method have the same time stamp.  Thus, the output is a chronological
merging of input events.
