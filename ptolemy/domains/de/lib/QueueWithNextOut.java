/**
   This actor implements an event queue.  When a token is received on the
   <i>input</i> port, it is stored in the queue.
   When the <i>trigger</i> port receives a token, the oldest element in the
   queue is output.  If there is no element in the queue when a
   token is received on the <i>trigger</i> port, then no output is
   produced.  The inputs can be of any token type, and the output
   is constrained to be of a type at least that of the <i>input</i>. <p>

   An additional output port, <i>nextOut</i>, has been added which allows
   the model to know what's next to come out.  This new output produces a
   token whenever the queue has been empty and a new token is queued.  It
   also produces an output whenever a token is taken from the queue and
   at least one token remains.  Otherwise, no output token is produced at
   <i>nextOut</i>.  The token produced is the oldest token remaining in
   the queue.  This output, also, is constrained to be at least that of
   <i>input</i> <p>
