/** This director implements the discrete-event model of computation (MoC).
 *  It should be used as the local director of a CompositeActor that is
 *  to be executed according to this MoC. This director maintains a notion
 *  of current time, and processes events chronologically in this time.
 *  An <i>event</i> is a token with a time stamp.  Much of the sophistication
 *  in this director is aimed at handling simultaneous events intelligently,
 *  so that deterministic behavior can be achieved.
 *  <p>
 *  The bottleneck in a typical DE simulator is in the mantainance of the
 *  global event queue. By default, a DE director uses the calendar queue 
 *  as the global event queue. It is currently the most efficient algorithm
 *  with O(1) time complexity in both enqueue and dequeue operations.
 *  <p>
 *  Sorting in the CalendarQueue class is done with respect to sort-keys
 *  which are implemented by the DEEventTag class. DEEventTag consists of a
 *  time stamp (double) and a depth (long). The time stamp
 *  indicates the time when the event occurs, and the depth
 *  indicates the relative priority of events with the same time stamp
 *  (i.e. simultaneous events).  The depth is determined by topologically
 *  sorting the ports according to data dependencies over which there
 *  is no time delay.
 *  <p>
 *  Several of the methods provided in this base class have two versions.
 *  One that deals with relative time (with respect to the current time) and
 *  another that deals with absolute time. While they are theoretically 
 *  equivalent, it is practically better to use the one with
 *  absolute time in case the data is already in that form. This will
 *  eliminate unnecessary quantization error. For example,
 *  if the current time is 10.0 and the actor needs to be refired at time
 *  20.0, then use fireAt(20.0) rather than fireAfterDelay(10.0).
 *  <p>
 *  Ports in the DE domain may be instances of DEIOPort. The DEIOPort class
 *  should be used whenever an actor introduces time delays between the
 *  inputs and the outputs. When ordinary IOPort is used, the scheduler
 *  assumes, for the purpose of calculating priorities, that the delay
 *  across the actor is zero. On the other hand, when DEIOPort is used,
 *  the delay across the actor is assumed to be non-zero, by default. We
 *  apologize for this potential confusion, but it is somewhat necessary for
 *  implementation efficiency in calculating receiver depths.
 *  <p>
 *  Input ports in a DE simulation contain instances of DEReceiver.
 *  When a token is put into a DEReceiver, that receiver enqueues the
 *  event by calling the _enqueueEvent() method of this director.
 *  This director sorts all such events in a global event queue
 *  (a priority queue) implemented as an instance of the CalendarQueue class.
 *  <p>
 *  Directed loops with no delay actors are not permitted; they would make
 *  impossible to assign priorities.  Such a loop can be broken by inserting
 *  an instance of the Delay actor with its delay set to zero.
 *  <p>
 *  At the beginning of the fire() method, this director dequeues
 *  the 'appropriate' oldest events (i.e. ones with smallest time
 *  stamp) from the global event queue, and puts those events into
 *  their corresponding receivers. The term 'appropriate' means that
 *  the events dequeued are chosen such that all events that are destined for
 *  the same actor and have the same time stamp are visible to that actor
 *  when it fires. That particular actor will then be called the 'firing
 *  actor'. If the oldest events are destined for multiple actors, then
 *  the choice of the firing actor is determined by the topological depth
 *  of the input ports of the actors.
 *  <p>
 *  Next step in the fire() method, the 'firing actor' is fired (i.e. its
 *  fire() method is invoked). The actor will consume events from
 *  its input port(s) and will usually produce new events on its output
 *  port(s). These new events will be enqueued in the global event queue
 *  until their time stamps equal the current time.
 *  <p>
 *  A DE domain simulation ends when the time stamp of the oldest events
 *  exceeds a preset stop time. This stopping condition is checked inside
 *  the prefire() method. It could also be ended when the global event queue
 *  becomes empty, which is the default behaviour. Sometimes, the desired
 *  behaviour is for the director to wait on an empty queue until another
 *  thread comes in and put events in it, e.g. wait for button pushes. Invoke
 *  the stopWhenQueueIsEmpty(boolean) method with <code>false</code> argument
 *  to achieve this behaviour.
 *  <p>
 *  NOTE: as mentioned before, all oldest events for the 'firing actor'
 *  are dequeued and put into the corresponding receivers. It is thus
 *  possible to have multiple simultaneous events put into the same receiver.
 *  These events will all be accessible by the actor during the firing
 *  phase, but it is not clear which one is ahead of which. This is, in fact,
 *  one source of nondeterminancy in discrete-event semantics. How to handle
 *  this is up to the designer of the actor.
 *  <p>
 *  Abstract base class for DE domain directors. In general, the methods
 *  provided in this base class are ones that do not depend on the
 *  implementation of the global event queue. This will enable different
 *  implementations to be compared in term of efficiency. The bottleneck
 *  in a typical DE simulator is in the mantainance of the global event
 *  queue. One good implementation is the calendar queue algorithm
 *  in ptolemy.actor.util.CalendarQueue class. This
 *  algorithm gives us O(1) time in both enqueue and dequeue operation.
 *  The DECQDirector class, which derives from DEDirector, uses
 *  this implementation.
 *  <p>
 *  Several of the methods provided in this base class have two versions.
 *  One that deals with relative time (with regards to the current time) and
 *  another that deal with absolute time. While it is theoretically equivalent
 *  to use one or the other, it is practically better to use the one with
 *  absolute time in case your data are already in that form. This will
 *  eliminate unnecessary quantization error, e.g. <i>A-B+B</i>. For example,
 *  if the current time is 10.0 and the actor needs to be refired at time
 *  20.0, then use fireAt(20.0) rather than fireAfterDelay(10.0).
