/** This interface defines the global event queue used by DE directors

 *  stamps, microstep and the depth of the destination actor.
 *  One DEEvent is said to be earlier than another, if it has
 *  a smaller time stamp, or when the time stamps are identical,
 *  it has a smaller microstep, or when both time stamps and
 *  microsteps are identical, it has a smaller depth.
 *  If all three entries are identical, the events are stored in
 *  a FIFO way.
