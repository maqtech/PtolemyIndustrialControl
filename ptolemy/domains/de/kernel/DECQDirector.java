/** This director implements the discrete-event model of computation (MoC).
 *  It should be used as the local director of a CompositeActor that is
 *  to be executed according to this MoC.  This director maintains a notion
 *  of current time, and processes events chronologically in this time.
 *  An <i>event</i> is a token with a time stamp.  Much of the sophistication
 *  in this director is aimed at handling simultaneous events intelligently,
 *  so that deterministic behavior can be achieved.
 *  <p>
 *  Input ports in a DE simulation are given instances of DEReceiver.
 *  When a token is put into a DEReceiver, that receiver enqueues the
 *  event by calling the _enqueueEvent() method of this director.
 *  This director sorts all such events in a global event queue
 *  (a priority queue) implemented as an instance of the CalendarQueue class.
 *  <p>
 *  Sorting in the CalendarQueue class is done with respect to sort-keys
 *  which are implemented by the DESortKey class. DESortKey consists of a
 *  time stamp (double) and a depth (long). The time stamp
 *  indicates the time when the event occurs, and the depth
 *  indicates the relative priority of events with the same time stamp
 *  (i.e. simultaneous events).  The depth is determined by topologically
 *  sorting the ports according to data dependencies over which there
 *  is no time delay.
 *  <p>
 *  Ports in the DE domain may be instances of DEIOPort. The DEIOPort class
 *  should be used whenever an actor introduces time delays between the
 *  inputs and the outputs. When ordinary IOPort is used, the scheduler
 *  assumes, for the purpose of calculating priorities, that the delay
 *  across the actor is zero.
 *  <p>
 *  Directed loops with no delay actors are not permitted; they would make
 *  impossible to assign priorities.  Such a loop can be broken with an
 *  instance of the Delay actor with its delay set to zero.
 *  <p>
 *  On invocation of the prefire() method, this director dequeues
 *  the 'appropriate' oldest events (i.e. ones with smallest time
 *  stamp) from the global event queue, and puts those events into
 *  their corresponding receivers. The term 'appropriate' means that
 *  the events dequeued are chosen such that all events that are destined for
 *  the same actor and have the same time stamp are visible to that actor
 *  when it fires. That particular actor will then be called the 'firing
 *  actor'. If the oldest events are destined for multiple actors, then
 *  the choice of the firing actor is determined by the topological depth
 *  of the input ports of the actors.
 *  <p>
 *  In the fire() method, the 'firing actor' is fired (i.e. its fire() method
 *  is invoked). The actor will consume events from
 *  its input port(s) and will usually produce new events on its output
 *  port(s). These new events will be enqueued in the global event queue
 *  until their time stamps equal the current time.
 *  <p>
 *  A DE domain simulation ends when the time stamp of the oldest events
 *  exceeds a preset stop time. This stopping condition is checked inside
 *  the prefire() method.
 *  <p>
 *  NOTE: as mentioned before, all oldest events for the 'firing actor'
 *  are dequeued and put into the corresponding receivers. It is thus
 *  possible to have multiple simultaneous events put into the same receiver.
 *  These events will all be accessible by the actor during the firing
 *  phase, but it is not clear which one is ahead of which. This is, in fact,
 *  one source of nondeterminancy in discrete-event semantics. How to handle
 *  this is up to the designer of the actor.
