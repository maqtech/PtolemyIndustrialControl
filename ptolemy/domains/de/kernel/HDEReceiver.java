//// DEReceiver

/** An implementation of the ptolemy.actor.Receiver interface for the
DE domain.  Tokens that are put into this receiver logically have time
stamps. If the time stamp is not explicitly given using the setDelay()
method, then it is assumed to be the current time (which is maintained
by the director).  The put() method sends the specified token to the
director, which returns it to this receiver (via the protected method
_triggerEvent()) when current time matches the time stamp of the
token. The get() method returns only tokens that the director has so
returned. Thus, when a token is put into the receiver using put(), it
does not become immediately available to the get() method.

<p>By default, the time stamp of a token is the current time of the
director when put() is called. To specify a time stamp in the future,
call setDelay() prior to calling put(). This should be done in a
synchronized manner, since there could be multiple thread running in
this domain.

<p>Before firing an actor, the director is expected to put at least one
token into at least one of the receivers contained by the actor.
