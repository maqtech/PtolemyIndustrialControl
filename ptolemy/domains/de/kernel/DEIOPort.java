//// DEIOPort
/**
   This port can be used by actors that are specialized to the discrete-event
   (DE) domain. It supports annotations that inform the scheduler about delays
   and about priorities for handling simultaneous inputs. It also provides
   two additional methods, overloaded versions of broadcast() and send().
   The overloaded versions have a second argument for the time delay,
   allowing actors to send output data with a time delay (relative to current
   time).
   <p>
   Actors in the DE domain are not required to use this port. If they use
   the base class, TypedIOPort, then the data they send is sent with zero delay.
