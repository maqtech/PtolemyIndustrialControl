/** This class implements the structure of events in Ptolemy II DE domain.
 *  Conceptually, an event in the Ptolemy II DE domain is an aggregation of
 *  a token and a tag. Actors communicate by sending events to each other.
 *  Thus, it makes sense for the implementation to include the
 *  destination actor and the destination receiver as fields in the DEEvent
 *  class, as well as the transferred token and the event tag mentioned
 *  previously.
 *  <p>
 *  A pure event is an event
 *  whose values of destination receiver and transferred token are null. This
 *  kind of event is usually used to trigger the activity of an actor at
 *  a specified time in the future.
