/**
   A base class for actors specific to the DE domain.  This class
   implements both SequenceActor and TimedActor.
   This class returns a new DEIOPort for the newPort() method.
   Although most DE specific actors extend this class,
   other (domain polymorphic) actors can also be used in the
   DE domain.
