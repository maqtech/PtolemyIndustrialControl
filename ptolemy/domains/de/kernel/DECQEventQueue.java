/**
A calendar queue implementation of the DE event queue. This stores DE
events in the order of their time stamps, microstep and the depth
of the destination actor. One DEEvent is said to be earlier than
another if it has
a smaller time stamp, or when the time stamps are identical and
it has a smaller microstep, or when both time stamps and
microsteps are identical and it has a smaller depth.
<P>
Its complexity is
theoretically O(1) for both enqueue and dequeue operations, assuming
a reasonable distribution of time stamps.
