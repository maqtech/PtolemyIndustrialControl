DE Simulation:</H3>
The following applet uses the Ptolemy II Discrete Event (DE) domain
to simulate a bus stop where passengers arrive with random probability
(according to Poisson process with unity mean inter-arrival time), and
buses arrive with either a fix inter-arrival time or random probability
(again according to Poisson process with variable mean inter-arrival time).
<P>
The top plot shows the passengers and buses arrival times. The buses
and passengers arrivals are plotted in red and blue impulses. All passengers
arriving before and at the time bus <I>i</I> arrives and after the time
bus
<I>i-1</I> arrives will get on bus <I>i</I>. On each bus arrival, all
passengers getting on that bus report their wait times. The wait times
are plotted on the same plot using green impulses.
<P>
The bottom plot shows the distribution histogram of all wait times.
The bin width used is equal to 0.1.
<P>You can interact with the applet by choosing one of the two bus arrival
time distributions, the stop time of the simulation, and the mean inter-arrival
time of the bus. Note that the mean inter-arrival time can be adjusted while
the simulation is running, and the change is immediately reflected by
the upper plot.
<P>
One can observe that if the bus arrives in fixed interval, <I>T</I>,
then the average waiting time will be equal to <I>0.5*T</I> and will be
uniformly distributed from 0 to <I>T</I>.
<BR>
On the other hand, if the bus arrives according to Poisson process,
then the average waiting time will be equal to <I>T</I> and will be 
exponentially distributed with mean <I>T</I>, where <I>T</I> is equal 
to the mean inter-arrival time.
