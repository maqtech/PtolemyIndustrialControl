This applet demonstrates the design of a threaded actor in the Ptolemy
II DE domain. The demo is taken from the ABRO specification described in
the Esterel language primer. The specification is as follow:
<pre>
	Emit an output O as soon as two inputs A and B have occured. 
	Reset this behavior each time the input R occurs.
</pre>
<P>
In this kind of specification, it is more natural to describe the actor by
providing a run() method that describes the actor activity during its 
lifetime. Compare this to writing a fire() method that describes the change
of state every time the method is called. The main difference between these
two schemes is that the first encodes the state in the position of the code,
while the latter (usually) has explicit state variables that got modified
whenever the fire() method is called.
<p>
Another advantage comes from the fact that the implementation permits 
users to mix these two kinds of actors in a topology, arbitrarily. As far
as the director knows, the threaded actor is just a regular actor. The 
DEThreadActor base class in DE kernel provides that encapsulation.
<p>
Although it is arguable that this is merely a syntactic sugar, it is often
beneficial to be able to write actor in the style that corresponds directly
with its state machine description. As such, it also suffers from 
<I>exponential state explosion</I> of state machine description in the form
of <I>exponential code length expansion</I>. Future research will
emphasize on ways to avoid this (e.g. Esterel like style).
