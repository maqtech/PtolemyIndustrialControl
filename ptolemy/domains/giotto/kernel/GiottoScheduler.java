/**
This class generates schedules for the actors in a CompositeActor
according to the Giotto semantics.
<p>
A schedule is represented by a tree. Consider the following CompositeActor:
<pre>
              +-----------------------+
              |           A           |
              +-----------------------+
              +-----------------------+
              |           B           |
              +-----------------------+
              +---------+   +---------+
              |    C    |   |    C    |
              +---------+   +---------+
</pre>
There are three actors A, B, and C, where C runs twice as often as A and B.
The tree representing the schedule for this CompositeActor looks as follows:
<pre>
+-------+               +-------+
| | | ----------------->| | |nil|
+-|-----+               +-|-----+
  |                       |
  V                       V
+-------+  +-------+    +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+
| | | ---->| | |nil|    | | | ---->|nil| ---->| | | ---->|nil|nil|
+-|-----+  +-|-----+    +-|-----+  +-------+  +-|-----+  +-------+
  |          |            |                     |
  V          V            V                     V
+---+      +---+        +-------+             +-------+
| A |      | B |        | | |nil|             | | |nil|
+---+      +---+        +-|-----+             +-|-----+
                          |                     |
                          V                     V
                        +---+                 +---+
                        | C |                 | C |
                        +---+                 +---+
</pre>
Note that repeated parts of the tree are shared, no deep cloning!
