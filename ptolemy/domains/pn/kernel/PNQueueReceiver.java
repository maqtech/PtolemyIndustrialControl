//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// PNQueueReceiver
/**

A receiver with a FIFO queue that blocks the calling process on a read if the 
FIFO queue is empty and on a write if the queue is full. Blocking read provides
the basic functionality of a FIFO channel in the process networks model of 
computation. Blocking write supports the implementation suggested by Parks for
bounded memory execution of process networks.
<p>
Tokens are appended to the queue with the put() method, which blocks on a write
if the queue is full. Tokens are removed from the queue with the get() method, 
which blocks on a read if the queue is empty.
In case a process blocks on a read or a write, the receiver informs the 
director about the same.
The receiver also unblocks processes blocked on a read or a write. In case
a process is blocked on a read (read-blocked), it is unblocked on availability
of a token.  If a process is blocked on a write (write-blocked), it
is unblocked on the availability of room in the queue and informs the director
of the same.
<p>
This class is also responsible for pausing or terminating a process that tries
to read from or write to the receiver. In case of termination, the receiver 
throws a TerminateProcessException when a process tries to read from or write 
to the receiver. This terminates the process. 
In case of pausing, the receiver suspends the process when it tries to read 
from or write to the receiver and resumes it only after a request to resume the
process has been received.
