//// TimedPNDirector
/**
A TimedPNDirector governs the execution of a CompositeActor with
Kahn-MacQueen process networks (PN) semantics extended by introduction of a
notion of global time. This model of computation has 
been extended to support mutations of graphs (dynamic changes to topology) in 
a deterministic way. 
<p>
The thread that calls the various execution methods (initialize, prefire, fire
and postfire) on the director is referred to as the <i>directing thread</i>. 
This directing thread might be the main thread responsible for the execution 
of the entire simulation or might be the thread created by the executive 
director of the containing composite actor.
<p>
In the PN domain, the director creates a thread (an instance of 
ProcessThread), representing a Kahn process, for each actor in the model. 
The threads are created in initialize() and started in the prefire() method 
of the ProcessDirector. A process is considered <i>active</i> from its 
creation until its termination. An active process can block when trying to 
read from a channel (read-blocked), when trying to write to a channel 
(write-blocked), when waiting for a queued topology change request to be
processed (mutation-blocked) or when waiting for time to progress 
(time-blocked). Time can
progress for an active process in this model of computation only when the
process is  blocked.
<p>
This director also permits pausing of the execution. An execution is paused
when all active processes are blocked or paused (at least one process is 
paused). In case of PN, a process can be paused only when it tries to 
communicate with other processes. Thus a process can be paused in the get() 
or put() methods of the receivers alone. In case a pause is requested, the 
process does not return from the call to the get() or the put() method of the
receiver until the execution is resumed. If there is a process that does 
not communicate with other processes in the model, then the simulation can 
never pause in that model.
<p>
A <i>deadlock</i> is when all the active processes are blocked.
The director is responsible for handling deadlocks during execution.
This director handles three different sorts of deadlocks, real deadlock, timed
deadlock and artificial deadlock. 
<p>
A real deadlock is when all the processes are blocked on a read meaning that
no process can proceed until it receives new data. The execution can be 
terminated, if desired, in such a situation. If the container of this director
does not have any input ports (as is in the case of a top-level composite 
actor), then the executive director or manager terminates the execution. 
If the container has input ports, then it is upto the 
executive director of the container to decide on the termination of the 
execution. To terminate the execution after detection of a real deadlock, the 
manager or the executive director calls wrapup() on the director.
<p>
An artificial deadlock is when all processes are blocked and at least one 
process is blocked on a write. In this case the director increases the 
capacity of the receiver with the smallest capacity amongst all the 
receivers on which a process is blocked on a write. 
This breaks the deadlock and the execution can proceed.
<p>
A timed deadlock is when all the processes under the control of this 
director are blocked, at least one process is blocked on a delay (time-blocked)
and no process is blocked on a write. This director supports a notion of global
time. All active processes that are not blocked and are executing concurrently
are executing at the same global time. A process that wants time to advance, 
suspends itself by calling the fireAt() method of the director and specifies 
the time it wants to be awakened at. Time can advance only when a timed 
deadlock occurs. In such a case, the director
processes requests for mutations, if any. Otherwise the director advances time
to the time when the first timed-blocked process can be awakened.
<p>
This director is capable of handling mutations of graphs (dynamic changes to 
topology). These mutations are deterministic and are performed only when a 
timed deadlock occurs and the mutations are pending (topology changes have been
requested). On requesting a mutation, the process queues the request 
and suspends (mutation-blocked) until the request for topology changes is 
processed. The directing thread processes these requests on the next occurence
of a timed-deadlock. After this the directing thread awakens the processes 
blocked on a mutation (mutation-blocked) and the execution resumes.
<p>
In case of PN, a process can be paused only when it tries to communicate with
other processes. A pause in PN is defined as a state when all processes are 
blocked or are explicitly paused in the get() or
put() method of the receiver. Thus if there is a process that does not 
communicate with other processes in the model, then the simulation may 
never pause in that model.
<p>
Though this class defines and uses a event-listener mechanism for notifying
the listeners of the various states a process is in, this mechanism is expected
to change to a great extent in the later versions of this class. A developer
must keep that in mind while building applications by using this mechanism. It
is highly recommended that the user do not use this mechanism as the future
changes might not be compatible with the current listener mechanism.<p>
