/**
A PNDirector governs the execution of a CompositeActor with extended 
Kahn-MacQueen process networks (PN) semantics. This model of computation has 
been extended to support mutations of graphs in a non-deterministic way. 
<p>
The thread that calls the various execution methods (initialize, prefire, fire
and postfire) on the director is referred to as the <i>directing thread</i>. 
This directing thread might be the main thread reponsible for the execution 
of the entire simulation or might be the thread created by the executive 
director of the containing composite actor.
<p>
In the PN domain, the director creates a thread (an instance of 
ProcessThread), representing a Kahn process, for each actor in the model. 
The threads are created in initialize() and started in the prefire() method 
of the ProcessDirector. A process is considered <i>active</i> from its 
creation until its termination. An active process can block when trying to 
read from a channel (read-blocked), when trying to write to a channel 
(write-blocked) or when waiting for a queued topology change request to be
processed (mutation-blocked). 
<p>
This director also permits pausing of the execution. An execution is paused
when all active processes are blocked or paused (atleast one process is 
paused). In case of PN, a process can be paused only when it tries to 
communicate with other processes. Thus a process can be paused in the get() 
or put() methods of the receivers alone. In case a pause is requested, the 
process does not return from the call to the get() or the put() method of the
receiver until the execution is resumed. If there is a process that does 
not communicate with other processes in the model, then the simulation can 
never pause in that model.
<p>
A <i>deadlock</i> is when all the active processes are blocked.
The director is responsible for handling deadlocks during execution.
This director handles two different sorts of deadlocks, real deadlock and
artificial deadlock. 
<p>
A real deadlock is when all the processes are blocked on a read meaning that
no process can proceed until it receives new data. The execution can be 
terminated, if desired, in such a situation. If the container of this director
is the top-level composite actor, then the manager terminates the execution. 
If the container is not the top-level composite actor, then it is upto the 
executive director of the container to decide on the termination of the 
execution. To terminate the execution, the manager or the executive director
calls wrapup() on the director.
<p>
An artificial deadlock is when all processes are blocked and atleast one 
process is blocked on a write. In this case the director increases the 
capacity of the receiver with the smallest capacity amongst all the 
receivers on which a process is blocked on a write. 
This breaks the deadlock and the execution can proceed.
<p>
This director is capable of handling dynamic changes to the topology, 
i.e. mutations of graphs. These mutations can be non-deterministic. In PN, 
since the execution of a model is not centralized, it is impossible to define 
a useful point in the execution of all the active processes where 
mutations can occur. Due to this, PN permits mutations
to happen as soon as they are requested. Thus as soon as a process queues 
mutations in PN, the director is notified and the director pauses the 
execution. Then it performs all the mutations requested, and notifies the 
topology listeners. After this the execution is resumed.
<p>
In case of PN, a process can be paused only when it tries to communicate with
other processes. A pause in PN is defined as a state when all processes are 
blocked or are explicitly paused in the get() or
put() method of the receiver. Thus if there is a process that does not 
communicate with other processes in the model, then the simulation may 
never pause in that model.
