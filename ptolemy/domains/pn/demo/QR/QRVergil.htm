A process network description of the QR example is shown below:

In this description, the nodes ND_1,
ND_2, ND_3, ND_4, and ND_5 describe processes and the edges between
these nodes describe FIFO buffers that have a certain capacity. The
processes read from these buffers using a blocking-read semantics. In
the applet, we simulate this process network to get the value for the
R matrix. The big difference between the Matlab program and the
process network is that the process network executes in parallel
whereas the Matlab description executes sequentially. </P>
<P>
In process <A HREF="ND_2.java">ND_2</A>, a large matrix is stored that
contains 500 real data samples taken from 16 antennas. From this
matrix, the process reads a number of samples (the number of
antenna's) and sends these samples to either node <A
HREF="ND_3.java">ND_3</A> or <A HREF="ND_4.java">ND_4</A>. This
process is repeated a number of times, as many times as there will be
a QR-update. Process ND_3 and process ND_4 read data from incoming
edges and producing data on outgoing edges. After the numbers of
QR-updates are done, the final matrix R is sent to process <A
HREF="ND_5.java">ND_5</A>, which sends the matrix <I>R</I> to the
Plotter and the StreamToMatrix actor. The latter one reconstructs from
the incoming stream a matrix, which is sent to the MatrixViewer to be
visualized. Process <A HREF="ND_1.java">ND_1</A> is used to properly
initialize the process network by sending a specific number of zeros
to either process ND_3 or process ND_4.
</P>
<P>
Process networks have the characteristic that they execute
<I>deterministically</I>, which means that the computation of the
result is independent of the scheduled order of the processes.
Thus, the thread scheduling strategy used by the Java virtual machine
to run the applet has no effect on the results of the run.
