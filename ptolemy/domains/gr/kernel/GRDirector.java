/**

<h1>GR overview</h1>
GR is a domain for displaying three-dimensional graphics in
Ptolemy II.  GR is an untimed domain that follows loop-less
synchronous/reactive (SR) semantics.

The basic idea behind the GR domain is to arrange geometry and transform
actors in a directed acyclic graph to represent the location and orientation
of objects in a scene. This topology of connected GR actors form what is
commonly called a scene graph in computer graphics literature.
The GR director converts the GR scene graph into a Java3D representation for
rendering on the computer screen.
