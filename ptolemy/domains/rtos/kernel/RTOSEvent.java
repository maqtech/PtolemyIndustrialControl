/** 
A RTOS event is an event that triggers the execution of a RTOS actor
(task). It has the information of the destination receiver, the 
destination actor, a token, 
the priority of the destination receiver, a flag <i>hasStarted</i>
indicating whether the processing of it has been started but has not
finished (typically due to preemption), and an <i>processingTime</i> 
for the time 
needed to finish processing this event. Note that for an event
that has been preempted, the <i>processingTime</i> is smalled than
the execution time of the destination actor. 
<p>
A event queue is used to sort these event, based on 
<pre>
- priority
- whether it has been started
</pre>
in that order.
<p>
Notice that a pure event (an event generated by calling fireAt() of
the director) is not a RTOS event. 
They are external events that carries time stamps, implemented
using the DEEvent class.
