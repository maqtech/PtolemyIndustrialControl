Composte actor in the CT domain. This class is derived from CompositeActor
and implements the CTStepSizeControlActor interface. If the director of
this composite actor is an instance of CTEmbeddedDirector, then the 
CTStepSizeControlActor calls will be delegated to its local director.
Otherwise, it returns defaullt values.
