//// CTCompositeActor
/**
   Composite actor in the CT domain. This class is derived from
   TypedCompositeActor and implements the CTStepSizeControlActor interface.
   Normally, in the CT domain, opaque composite actors are not fired
   in every iteration. They are only fired in discrete iterations,
   when there is a possibility of events. Actors that implement
   the CTStepSizeControlActor interface, however, such as this one,
   are fired in every iteration.
   <p>
   The key task of this actor is to implement step-size control methods.
   If the director of this composite actor is an instance of
   CTTransparentDirector, then the CTStepSizeControlActor calls
   will be delegated to its local director. Otherwise, they return
   default values.
   <P>
   This composite actor should be used when a CT subsystem needs to transfer
   its step size control information to the outer domain. Typical usage
   includes CT inside CT or CT inside FSM inside CT.  If you construct
   a modal model, then by default, refinements of the modes are actors
   like this one that implement the CTStepSizeControlActor interface.
