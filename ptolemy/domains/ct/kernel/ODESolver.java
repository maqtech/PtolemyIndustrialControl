/**
Abstract base class for ODE solvers. The key method for the class is
resolveState(), which executes the integration method for one
step. This method does not consider any breakpoints. In general,
resolveState() will resolve the integrators' new states.
Step size control (including error control) is performed by the
director, but solvers may provide support for it.
How the states are resolved and how the errors are controlled are
solver dependent.  Derived classes
may implement these methods according to individual ODE
solving algorithms.
<P>
The behavior of integrators also changes
when changing the ODE solver, so this class provides some methods
for the integrators too, including the fire() method and the step size
control related methods. Here we use the strategy and delegation design
patterns. CTBaseIntegrator delegated its corresponding
methods to this class. And subclasses of this class provide concrete
implementations of these methods.
<P>
An integer called "round" is used to indicate the number of firing rounds
within one iteration. For some integration methods, (i.e. the so called
explicit methods) the round of firings are fixed.
For some others (i.e. implicit methods), the round could be an arbitrary
positive integer.
<P>
A round counter is a counter
for the number of fire() rounds in one iteration to help the actors that
may behave differently under different rounds. The round can be got by
the getRound() method. The incrementRound() method will increase the
counter by one, and resetRound() will always reset the counter to 0.
<P>
Conceptually, ODE solvers do not maintain simulation parameters,
like step sizes and error tolerance.
They get these parameters from the director. So the same set of parameters
are shared by all the solvers in a simulation.
