//// CTMultiSolverDirector
/**
   A CTDirector that uses multiple ODE solvers. The reason for switching
   solvers is that when abrupt changes in signals or actor functions
   (also called breakpoints) occur, the state of the system
   has to be recalculated.
   At these points, a special ODE solver, called the "breakpointODESolver"
   is used. The simulation is executed as if the breakpoint is a new
   starting point. Typically, breakpointODESolvers do not advance time.
   <P>
   This director handles both predictable breakpoints, which are breakpoints
   that are registered in the breakpoint table, and unpredictable breakpoints,
   which are breakpoints that are not known before hand.
   <P>
   This director can only be a top-level director. For a CT domain inside
   an opaque composite actor, use CTMixedSignalDirector (if the outer
   domain is discrete) or CTEmbeddedDirector (if the outer domain is
   a CT domain or a HS domain.)
   <P>
   This director recognizes actors that implement the CTStepSizeControlActor
   interface. To adjust step sizes, it polls such actors.  If all are
   content with the current step size, then it attempts to raise the
   step size.  If any is not content, then it reduces the step size.
   If there are no such actors, then it leaves the step size where it is.
   <P>
   This director has two more parameters than the CTDirector base
   class.<BR>
   <UL>
   <LI><I>ODESolver</I>: This is the name of the normal ODE solver
   used in nonbreakpoint iterations.
   <LI><I>breakpointODESolver</I>: This is the name of the ODE solver that
   is used in the iterations just after the breakpoint. The breakpoint
   ODE solvers should not require history information (this property
   is called self-start). The default is
   "ptolemy.domains.ct.kernel.solver.DerivativeResolver"
   If there are Dirac impulses in the system, the
   "ptolemy.domains.ct.kernel.solver.ImpulseBESolver" may give
   a better result.
   <LI>All other parameters are maintained by the CTDirector base class. And the
   two solvers share them.
