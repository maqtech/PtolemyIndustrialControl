//// CTActor
/**
CTActor is the base class for continuous time actors.
<P>
CTActors can have parameters attached. The parameters can be set by the
setParam() method at any time, but the parameter will not be used
immediately until it is updated by the updateParams() method. When a
parameter is changed, the <code>paramChanged</code> flag is set.
The parameter will be updated in the updateParams() method, if the
<code>paramChanged</code> flag is set.  In this base class,
 the updateParams() happens at the prefire()
stage of the iteration, so that the parameters are keep consistent
during the iteration.
