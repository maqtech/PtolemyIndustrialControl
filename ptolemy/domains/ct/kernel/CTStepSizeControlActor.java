/**
Interface for actors that controls integration step sizes for handling
unpredictable breakpoints or controlling numerical error.
Typically, the actors that implement this interface are dynamic actors
and event detectors.
<P>
Actors can affect the integration step size in two ways. The first one
is by introducing predictable breakpoints. When the fireAt() method of
the CTDirector is called with an argument <i>t</i>,
the CTDirector will treat <i>t</i> as a breakpoint. Actors that only
introduce predictable breakpoints need not to implement this interface.
<P>
The second way of controlling step size is through the accuracy checking
after each integration step. Accuracy, in this context, means that
the numerical integration error is less than the error tolerance and
there is no (unpredictable) breakpoints within this step.
Actors that uses this mechanism need to implement this interface.
At the end of each integration step, each CTStepSizeControlActors
will be asked whether this step is accurate by calling their
isThisStepAccurate() method.
If it returns false, that actor
will then be asked to suggest a refined step size. If there are more
than one actors find that this step is not accurate, then the
smallest of the suggested step size will be
used by the director to restart the integration step.

If all step size control actors find the integration step is accurate,
they will be asked for a (predicted) next step size.
The smallest predicted next step size will be used for the next
integration step.
<P>
If there are no step size control actors in a model, the step sizes
are solely controlled by the director based on the initial
step size parameter, ODE solvers, and predictable breakpoints.
