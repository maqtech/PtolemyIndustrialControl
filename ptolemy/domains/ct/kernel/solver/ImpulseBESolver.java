/**
   This class implements the impulse backward Euler ODE solver. This solver
   uses two backward Euler solving processes to handle Dirac delta functions
   in a CT system. The first backward Euler process use the minimum step size
   h, and the second backward Euler process use the negative step
   size, -h. That is, for ODE
   <pre>
   x' = f(x, t), x(0) = x0
   </pre>
   This solver performs the following two steps
   <pre>
   x(t+h) = x(t) + h * x'(t+h)
   x(t+) = x(t+h) - h * x'(t+)
   </pre>
   <P>
   By using this solver, we can find the state of the system at t+, which is
   the time at which the impulse occurs, but the effect of the impulse is
   taken care of.
   <P>
   This ODE solver does not advance time. So it can only be used as
   a breakpoint solver.
