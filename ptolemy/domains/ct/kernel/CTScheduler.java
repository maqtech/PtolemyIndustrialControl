/**
Static scheduler for the CT domain.
A CT (sub)system can be mathematically represented as:<Br>
<pre>
<pre>    dx/dt = f(x, u, t)<Br>
<pre>    y = g(x, u, t)<BR>
</pre></pre></pre>
where x is the state of the system, u is the input, y is the output,
f() is the state transition map and g() is the output map.
<P>
The system is built by actors. That is, all the functions, f() and g(),
are built up by chains of actors.  For high order systems,
x is a vector, which is built up by more than one integrators.
In general, actors that have the functionality of integration
from their inputs to their outputs are called <I>dynamic actors</I>.
Other actors are called <I>arithmetic actors</I>.
<P>
In order to interact with discrete domains, some actors in the
CT domain are able to convert continuous waveforms to discrete events,
and vice versa. An actor that has continuous input and discrete
output is call an <I>event generator</I>; an actor that has
discrete input and continuous output is called a
<I>waveform generator</I>.
<P>
The interaction with some discrete domains requires that the
CT simulation be able to remember its state and roll-back
to the remembered state when needed. This in turn requires
that all actors which have internal states should be able
to remember and restore their states. These actors are called
<I>stateful actors</I>.
<P>
In the continuous time simulation, time progresses in a discrete way.
The distance between consecutive simulation time points are called
<I>integration step size</I> or step size, in short. Some actors
require specific step sizes of the simulation. These actors are
called <I>step size control actors</I>. Examples of step size
control actors include integrators, which control the
accuracy and speed of numerical ODE solutions, and some event
generators, which detect events.
<P>
To help the scheduling, a system topology is partitioned into
several clusters:
the <I>arithmetic actors</I>, the <I>dynamic actors</I>,
the <I>step size control actors</I>, the <I>sink actors</I>,
the <I>stateful actors</I>, the <I> event generators</I>,
and the <I> waveform generators</I>.
This scheduler uses the clustered information and the system topology,
to provide the firing sequences for evaluating f() and g().
It also provides a firing order for all the dynamic actors.
The firing sequence for evaluating f() is
called the <I> state transition schedule</I>; the firing
sequence for evaluating g() is called the <I> output schedule</I>;
and the firing sequence for dynamic actors is called the
<I>dynamic actor schedule</I>.
<P>
The state transition schedule is the actors in f() function sorted
in the topological order, such that, after the integrators emit their
state x, a chain of firings according to the schedule evaluates the
f() function and returns tokens corresponding to dx/dt to the
integrators.
<P>
The output schedule is the actors in g() function sorted in the topological
order.
<P>
The dynamic actor schedule is a list of dynamic actors in their reverse
topological order.
<P>
If there are loops of arithmetic actors or loops of integrators,
then the (sub)system is not schedulable, and a NotSchedulableException
will be thrown if schedules are requested.
