Problem:</H1>
Five philosophers are seated at a table with a large bowl of food in 
the middle. Between each pair of philosophers is one chopstick, and to 
eat a philosopher must use both chopsticks beside him. Each philosopher 
spends his life in the following cycle: He thinks for a while, gets hungry,
 picks up one of the chopsticks beside him, then the other, eats for a 
while and puts the chopsticks down on the table again. If a philosopher 
tries to grab a chopstick  but it is already being used by another 
philosopher, then the philosopher waits until that chopstick becomes 
available. This implies that no neighbouring philosophers can eat at the 
same time and at most two philosophers can eat at a time.

The Dining Philosophers problem was first dreamt up by Edsger W. Dijkstra 
in 1965. It is a classic concurrent programming problem that illustrates 
the two basic properties of concurrent programming:
<LI>
<B>Liveness</B>. How can we design the program to avoid deadlock, where 
none of the the philosophers can make progress because each is waiting 
for someone else to do something?
<LI>
<B>Fairness</B>. How can we design the program to avoid starvation, where 
one of the philosophers could make progress but does not because others 
always go first?
</LI>
<P >
The above applet uses an algorithm that lets each philosopher randomly chose 
which chopstick to pick up first, and all philosophers eat and think at the 
same rates. This algorithm is fair as any time a chopstick is not being used 
and both philosophers try to use it, they both have an equal chance of 
succeeding. However this algorithm does not guarantee the absence of 
deadlock, and if it is let run long enough this will eventually occur. 
The probability that deadlock occurs sooner increases as he thinking 
times are decreased relative to the eating times.
