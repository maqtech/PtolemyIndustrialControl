<h1>The Parameterized Synchronous Dataflow (PSDF)</h1>
<P>
   The Parameterized Synchronous Dataflow (PSDF) domain is an
   extension of the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) domain that allows for
   more extensive reconfiguration of models.  The SDF domain uses
   static analysis of variable dependence to detect cases where rate
   parameters may change.  By default, SDF disallows reconfiguration
   of all rate parameters.  If rate parameters are allowed to change,
   then SDF checks that rate parameters do not change during execution
   of the schedule, and declares that inferred rate parameters for
   external ports change as often as the internal rate parameters.

   <p>This domain offers two key extensions:
   <ol>
   <li> Dependence analysis is used to determine if the modification to the
   rate parameters occurs during execution of the SDF schedule.  If
   this test passes, then a parameterized schedule is constructed.

   <li> The generated schedule is checked for local synchrony, to determine
   if external rate parameters may change.  The correct dependency
   information for external ports is then declared.

   </ol>

   Note that the resulting behavior is identical to the SDF scheduler,
   with rate parameter changes allowed, except much more efficient, since
   scheduling on the fly is not necessary during every reconfiguration.
   Additionally, code can be generated for the PSDF domain that allows
   for efficient reconfiguration.  The added precision of dependency analysis
   for external rate parameters also means that some hierarchical models that
   would be ruled out by the SDF checks are allowed.
