The Synchronous Publisher Subscriber (SPS) model of computation.
<p>
In this model of computation input and output ports have channel names
that are similar to publisher and subscribers.  The output port name may
have wildcards, which may be matched by input ports.  Output ports may
have initial values.  If an output port does not have an initial value,
then a default value of zero is used.  The actual default value depends
on the token type.
</p>

<p>The way the execution occurs is that during the first iteration,
the output ports are initialized with the initial values.  The corresponding
input ports are then updated.  The actors are fired and the values
of the output ports are updated and the iteration ends.</p>

<p>This model of computation is similar to a Cellular Automaton model
of computation.  This model of computation differs from the
ptolemy/domains/ca/kernel/CADirector.java in that CADirector operates
on a matrix and the value of a cell is dependent on the values
of the adjacent values in the matrix.  In this model of computation,
values may depend on many different values.</p>

<p>This model of computation may be a subset of Linda.</p>
