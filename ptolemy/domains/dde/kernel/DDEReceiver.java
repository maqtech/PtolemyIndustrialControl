//// DDEReceiver
/**
A DDEReceiver stores time stamped tokens according to distributed
discrete event semantics. A <I>time stamped token</I> is a token
that has a time stamp associated with it. A DDEReceiver stores time
stamped tokens by enforcing a blocking read and blocking write style.
Time stamped tokens are appended to the queue with one of the two put()
methods, both of which block on a write if the queue is full. Time
stamped tokens are removed from the queue via the get() method. The
get() method will throw a NoTokenException if it is invoked when the
hasToken() method returns false.
<P>
Each DDEReceiver is managed by a TimeKeeper. A single time keeper is
assigned to manage all of the receivers of a given actor by keeping
track of the actor's local notion of time. As tokens are consumed
(returned by the get() method) in a receiver, the local time of the
actor will advance to the value of the consumed token's time stamp.
The hasToken() method of a receiver will return true only if the
receiver's get() method will result in the minimum advancement of local
time with respect to all of the receivers controlled by the TimeKeeper.
If the get() method of multiple receivers will result in a minimum
but identical local time advancement, then the hasToken() method of the
receiver with the highest priority will return true (the others will 
return false).
<P>
If a receiver with a nonnegative receiver time is empty, then the
hasToken() method will perform a blocking read. Once, a token is
available then hasToken() will return true or false according to
the minimum time advancement rules cited in the preceding paragraph.
Note that hasToken() blocks while get() does not block.
<P>
DDEReceivers process certain events that are hidden from view by
ports and actors. In particular, NullTokens have time stamps with
a value of PrioritizedTimedQueue.IGNORE. NullTokens allow actors 
to communicate information on their local time advancement to
neighboring actors without the need for an actual data exchange.
NullTokens are passed at the receiver level and circumvent the
Ptolemy II data typing mechanism.
<P>
Time stamps of value PrioritizedTimedQueue.IGNORE are used to initiate
execution in feedback cycles. If a receiver has a time stamp with
value IGNORE, then it will not be considered when determining which
receiver's get() method will result in the minimum local time
advancement. Once a single token has been consumed by any other
receiver, then the event with time stamp of value IGNORE will be
removed. If all receivers have receiver times of IGNORE, then all
such events will be removed.
<P>
IMPORTANT: This class assumes that valid time stamps have non-negative
values. Reserved negative values exist for special purposes: INACTIVE
and IGNORE. These values are attributes of PrioritizedTimedQueue.
