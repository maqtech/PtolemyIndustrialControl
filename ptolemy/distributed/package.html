The ptolemy.distributed package domain is an extended 
version of the existing Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) domain
that performs the simulation in a distributed manner.

 <p>The ptolemy.distributed package was developed by
Daniel Lazaro Cuadrado (Aalborg University).

 <p>The ptolemy.distributed package uses Jini, which is "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jini">a network architecture for
the construction of distributed systems in the form of modular
co-operating services</a>".

<h2>Building the ptolemy.distributed package</h2>

We include Jini jar files
in <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/distributed/jini/jar/</CODE>.

 <p>When <CODE>./configure</CODE> in the <CODE>$PTII</CODE>
directory, is run, it searches for the Jini jar files
and sets corresponding variables in <CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk</CODE>
for use by <CODE>make</CODE>
and <CODE>$PTII/.classpath</CODE> for use by Eclipse.

<h3>Building Ptolemy using configure</h3>

 <p>If you are running <CODE>configure</CODE> to setup
your environment and then running
<CODE>make</CODE> or using Eclipse, then do:
<pre>
cd $PTII
./configure
</pre>
You should see:
<pre>
checking for jini directory... /home/eecs/cxh/ptII/ptolemy/distributed/jini
checking for jars used by jini... jini-core.jar jini-ext.jar sun-util.jar ok
</pre>
If, instead, you see
<pre>
checking for jini directory... configure: WARNING: Perhaps Jini is not installed?
    You need not download Jini unless you plan on use the
    distributed Ptolemy feature in ptolemy/distributed.
    Jini can be downloaded from http://www.jini.org, the
    jini-core.jar jini-ext.jar sun-util.jar copied to
    $PTII/ptolemy/distributed/jini/jars
    and configure rerun.
</pre>
Then you need to obtain jini from <a href="http://www.jini.org"><CODE>http://www.jini.org</CODE></a>,
place <CODE>jini-core.jar</CODE>, <CODE>jini-ext.jar</CODE> and <CODE>sun-util.jar</CODE>
in <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/jini/jars</CODE> and rerun <CODE>configure.</CODE>

 <p>If you are not using <CODE>configure</CODE>, then
you will need to add the jar files by hand to the classpath
of your tool.
 <p>Note that the <CODE>$PTII/.classpath.default</CODE> file
that can be used to set up Eclipse <B>excludes</B> 
<CODE>ptolemy/distributed</CODE>, so if you are using
Eclipse <B>do not</B> use <CODE>$PTII/.classpath.default</CODE>.
Instead, use <CODE>configure</CODE> as per
<a href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/nightly/doc/coding/eclipse.htm"><CODE>$PTII/doc/coding/eclipse.htm</CODE></a>.
