Hybrid systems are systems with continuous-time dynamics, discrete
events, and discrete mode changes. This visual modeler supports construction of
hierarchical hybrid systems. It uses a block-diagram representation of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to define continuous
dynamics. It uses a bubble-and-arc diagram representation of finite state
machines to define discrete behavior.
<p>
Below are simple demonstrations of this modeler:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/StickyMasses/StickyMasses.xml">
Sticky masses</a>.
<br> This example models a physical system consisting of two point masses
on springs that stick together when they collide.  It illustrates how
to model systems when different modes of operation require different
ODE models.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/Thermostat/Thermostat.xml">
Thermostat</a>.
<br> This example models a thermostat in a simple physical
environment. It illustrates how to model systems when a single
ODE model has parameters whose values change discretely.
</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/BouncingBall/BouncingBallWithoutGR.xml">
Bouncing Ball</a>.
<br> This example shows a bouncing ball model. Like the previous
example, it has a single ODE model with parameters whose values change
discretely. Unlike the previous example, however, it exhibits a
so-called "Zeno condition," where the time between events gets
arbitrarily small.</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/Switch/Switch.xml">
Switch</a>.
<br> This example shows a switch that selects from one of two
continuous-time inputs.  It illustrates how to model systems
where continuous-time signals are mixed with discrete-event signals.
Such systems are called "mixed-signal" systems.</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/SquareWave/SquareWave.xml">
Square Wave Response</a>.
<br> This example shows a linear transfer function given as a
rational Laplace transform, and its response to a square wave
input. This model is not a hybrid system, but a classical continuous-time
dynamical system.</li>
<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/Lorenz/Lorenz.xml">
Lorenz Attractor</a>.
<br> This example shows a nonlinear system constructed using
integrators and expression actors in a feedback loop. Because of
the nonlinearity, the system exhibits a form of chaotic behavior
known as a strange attractor.
This model is not a hybrid system, but a classical nonlinear continuous-time
dynamical system.</li>
</ul>

This visual modeler is built using Ptolemy II, which is a software
framework developed as part of the Ptolemy project at the University of
California at Berkeley. See the

page</a> for more information.
