<ul>
<li><b>My model hangs, failing to make progress</b>. In the DE domain,
       if an actor has input tokens that it fails to consume when it is
       fired, then it the director will continue to fire it repeatedly
       until those tokens are consumed.  Actors in the DE domain must
       consume pending input tokens.</li>
