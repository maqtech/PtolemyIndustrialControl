The following links open Ptolemy models in Vergil.
To run the models, follow the link, then select "Run Window"
from the "View" menu.
The diagrams are fully editable, so feel free to explore.
The top-level parameters are the model are shown in the run window.
Edit these to explore the models.  They can be edited while the
models are running.
<ul>
<li><a href="demo/modulation.xml">Spectrum of a modulated sine wave</a>.
<br> This example shows simple spectral estimation of the product
of two sinusoids in noise.  It illustrates hierarchical models,
the Expression actor, and the FFT actor.
The Sinewave actors with the blue outline are hierarchical.
Right click on them and select "look inside" to see their refinement.
This model is build using the <i>synchronous dataflow</i> (SDF) domain,
which statically schedules the firing of the actors.

<li><a href="demo/eye.xml">Eye diagram of a PAM communications signal</a>.
<br> This example shows a simple pulse-amplitude moduldation, physical
layer communication system.  It illustrates live parameter editing and
the scope style plotter.  To get documentation on any actor, right
click on it, and select "Get Documentation."
</br></li>

<li><a href="demo/lorenz.xml">Lorenz attractor chaotic system</a>.
<br> This example shows a nonlinear feedback system that exhibits
chaotic behavior.  It illustrates the continuous-time (CT) domain,
which uses an underlying solver for ordinary differential equations,
the Expression actor, and the X-Y plotter.
</br></li>

<li>Hybrid system model.
<br> This example illustrates the use of the finite-state-machine (FSM)
domain together with another domain to get a <i>modal model</i>.
A special case of modal models are <i>hybrid systems</i>, where FSM
is combined with CT.</br></li>
</br></li>

<li><a href="../../domains/gr/demo/pendulum/pendulum.xml">
Pendulum model</a>.
<font color="red">NOTE: This model requires that you have
installed Java 3D from Sun.</font>
This example shows a continuous-time physical model of pendulum
animated in the graphics (GR) domain, in which graphical components
can be assembled and dynamically manipulated.  Note that clicking
and dragging in the graphics window rotates the model.
