<!--
Note:  demos should go with in the directory of their respective
domains. Demo xml files should usually be upper case, and have the
same name as the directory they reside in; so we should
have sdf/demo/Foo/Foo.xml.
The reason that the xml files are upcased is so that if
we do codegen, we get Foo.java instead of foo.java

The following links open models that highlight the
key features of Ptolemy II. To run the models,
follow the link, then select "Run Window" from the "View" menu. The
diagrams are fully editable, so feel free to explore. The top-level
parameters are the model are shown in the run window. Edit these to
explore the models. They can be edited while the models are running.
You can also access the <a href="completeDemos.htm">complete
list of demos</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../domains/sdf/demo/Spectrum/Spectrum.xml">
Simple Signal Processing</a>.
<br> This example shows simple spectral estimation of the product
of two sinusoids in noise.  It illustrates models for signal
processing, hierarchical models,
the Expression actor, and the FFT actor.
This model is build using the <i>synchronous dataflow</i> (SDF) domain,
which statically schedules the firing of the actors.
</li>

<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/Lorenz/Lorenz.xml">
Continuous-Time Modeling</a>.
<br> This example shows a continuous-time
nonlinear feedback system that exhibits
chaotic behavior (this system is called a Lorenz attractor).
It illustrates the <i>continuous-time</i> (CT) domain,
which uses an underlying solver for ordinary differential equations.
</li>

<li><a href="../../domains/de/demo/Inspection/Inspection.xml">
Discrete-Event Modeling</a>.
<br> This example shows
a famous paradox in probability called the inspection paradox.
It illustrates use of the <i>discrete-event</i> (DE) domain, where
events occur on a time line and are processed chronologically.
In this example, random
data stimulates a model and statistics are collected and reported
in various ways.
</li>

<li> <a href="../../domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.xml">
Modal Models</a> (New in Ptolemy II 2.0).
<br>A modal model is one whose behavior depends on its "mode"
of operation. A modal model in Ptolemy II uses the
<i>finite state machine</i> (FSM) domain
combined hierarchically with other models. A state in the FSM represents
a mode of operation, and can have a refinement that gives the behavior
in that mode.
The refinement can be another FSM or some other model using some other
Ptolemy domain. This example combines DE, FSM, and SDF to model a
system where regularly sampled signals are perturbed by irregular
events in time.
</li>

<li><a href="../../domains/ct/demo/StickyMasses/StickyMasses.xml">
Hybrid Systems</a> (Modal version is new in Ptolemy II 2.0).
<br> <i>Hybrid systems</i> are a special case of modal models
where the FSM domain is combined with the CT domain
to get mixed continuous-time and discrete-event models.
This example models a physical system consisting of two point masses
on springs that stick together when they collide.
</li>

<li><a href="../../data/type/demo/Router/Router.xml">
The Type System</a>.<br>
This model illustrates the very sophisticated type system
of Ptolemy II, where type constraints propagate transparently,
actors are polymorphic, and composite types such as records and
arrays are supported.
This example illustrates composite types, where records are
constructed out of tokens with various types. Here, a record
models a packet in a packet-switched network, where variable
delays may result in out-of-order arrival of packets.
</li>

<li>
<a href="../../data/unit/demo/Units/Units.xml">
Unit Systems</a> (New in Ptolemy II 2.0).
<br>
This model illustrates the use of Ptolemy II unit systems. A unit system
defines a set of interrelated dimensions and measures. For example, in
the time dimension, we might have seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
and fortnights. The Ptolemy II unit system allows us to express
quantities equivalently with different units, and keeps track of the
units through mathematical operations. For example, one centimeter
divided by one millisecond is equal to 10 meters/second. This is
expressed in the expression language as "1*cm/ms" or "10 m/second",
where "cm", "ms", "m", and "second" are defined in the unit system. A
unit system is a modular component that one drags into a model.
</li>

<li><a href="../../moml/demo/Networked/Networked.xml">
Network Integration</a>.<br>
This example illustrates that models may be defined in a networked,
distributed fashion.
This model contains a component that is defined on the Ptolemy project
website.  When you open the model, you will be alerted to the fact
that it requires loading a model definition from a remote source.
If you agree to proceed, then you will have a model with a remotely
defined component.  The component itself is at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml">
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml</a>.
You can open that definition by clicking on the hyperlink, or by
using the "Open URL" command in the File menu.

<h1>Experimental Facilities</h1>
<p>
Ptolemy II has a number of less well-developed experimental
capabilities that may continue to evolve over time.
These are illustrated in the following examples.

<ul>
<!--vergilDocs-->
<li><a href="../../actor/lib/javasound/demo/KarplusStrong/KarplusStrong.xml">
Audio</a>.<br>
This example shows the Karplus-Strong algorithm, which synthesizes
a musical sound that closely resembles a plucked string instrument.
It illustrates the audio capabilities of Ptolemy II, which require
version 1.3 of Java, and a reasonably capable computer.
