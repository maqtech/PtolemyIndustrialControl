<h2><a name="other">Other Key New Capabilities</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li> A Token can now be "nil", which means that the data is missing.
If <a href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/data/Token.html#nil()">Token.nil()</a> is
called, it indicates that a token is a nil or missing token, which contains no data.
  Nil or missing tokens are common in analytical systems like R and SAS
  where they are used to handle sparsely populated data sources.
  In database parlance, missing tokens are sometimes called 
  null tokens.  Since null is a Java keyword, we use the term "nil".
The PN <a href="../../domains/pn/demo/RemoveNilTokens/RemoveNilTokens.xml">Remove Nil Tokens</a>
demo illustrates use of nil tokens.
</ul>

<h2><a name="libraries">New and Enhanced Actor Libraries</a>
</h2>
A number of new and enhanced actor libraries are included in version 6.1
You may also wish to refer to the
<a href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/lib/package-summary.html">ptolemy.actor.lib</a>
package, where most of the domain-polymorphic actors reside (domain-polymorphic actors are
those that can be used in more than one domain).
