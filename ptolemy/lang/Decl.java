//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Decl
/**
 *  A Decl encapsulates information about a declaration of some entity.
 *  There is a unique Decl for each Decl in the compilation.
 *
 *  The class Decl and its subclasses declare attributes, most of which make
 *  sense only for certain types of Decl.  Attempts to access nonsensical
 *  attributes will cause runtime errors.
 *
 *  By convention, a Decl member named "getFoo" will return the "foo"
 *  attribute when called with no parameters, and set the "foo"
 *  attribute when called with one parameter.  Thus, decl.getType() is
 *  the type of the entity referred to by decl (a Decl, presumably),
 *  and decl.setFoo(aType) sets the type attribute of decl to aType.
 *  Also, if member "foo" is not valid for all Decls, there is a member
 *  "hasFoo()" that returns true or false depending on whether object
 *  on which it is called has a class for which "foo" may be called.
 *
 *  Objects of type Decl should not be allocated; the class is intended
 *  as a base class for others.
 *
 *   ATTRIBUTE name
 *     All Decls have a name, of type String.  These are
 *     the unique representative strings assigned by lexical analysis.
 *     The names of two Decls are considered the same iff they are the
 *     same pointer, ignoring contents: names that are different pointers
 *     to strings containing the same characters are considered distinct.
 *
 *  This class and comments were converted from Decl in the Titanium project.
