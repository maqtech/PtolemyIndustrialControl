This directory contains a first version of code to save Ptolemy II topologies
as standalone Java implementations. This version does not support hierarchy or
parameter value settings, so it is very restricted.

To test out the code, first compile the three java files,
and then run

java TestSave test.xml
java TestSave/test2.xml

Then look at the generated files test.java and test2.java.
