\section{Introduction}

This document gives an outline of a general 2D softwalls approach.  We
assume the initial speed is known.

\section{Step Bias}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose the aircraft is travelling at a constant speed $s$.  Let
$\theta$ denote the aircraft's heading angle, and let
$\dot{\theta_{p}}$ be the pilot's control input, i.e. the desired rate
of change in heading angle.  At that speed, the aircraft has a
minimum-safe turning radius $r_{min}$.  This contrains the paths at
which the aircraft can bank right or left as in figure \ref{paths}.

\begin{figure}[btp]

\figcaption{The dot represents the aircraft, which is moving along the
center path.  The arc paths represtent turns at the minimum turning radius.
\label{paths}}
\end{figure}

Now suppose we wish to prevent the aircraft from crossing a boundry.
As the aircraft approaches the boundry, one of minimum-turning-radius
paths will interesect with the boundry.  As long as the other path has
not yet interestected the boundry, the aircraft can still avoid
crossing the boundry by turning along this path.  When the other path
intersects the boundry, turning along this path until one of the paths
no longer intersects the boundry will prevent the aircraft from
crossing the boundry.

If the actual rate of change in aircraft heading angle be
$\dot{\theta}$, and we limit this value to the safe range
$[-s/r_{min}, s/r_{min}]$, we can view this controller as follows:

Let $\theta_{s}$, be the softwalls-generated control signal.  We
calculate $\dot{\theta}$ from
\[
\dot{\theta} = limit_{[-s/r_{min}, s/r_{min}]}(\dot{\theta_{p}} -
\dot{\theta_{s}},
\]
where
\[
\set{limit}_{[a,b]}(u) = \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
b&\mbox{ if } u > b,\\
a&\mbox{ if } u < a,\\
u&\mbox{ otherwise. }
\end{array}
\right .
\]

Assuming $\dot{\theta_{p}}$ is limited to $[-\dot{\theta_{M}},
\dot{\theta_{M}}]$, which corresponds to the limits of the flight
yoke, we can choose $\dot{\theta_{s}} = \dot{\theta_{M}} + s/r_{min}$
to force the aircraft to turn right at the maximum turning radius,
irrespective of pilot input.  Similarly $\dot{\theta_{s}} =
-\dot{\theta_{M}} - s/r_{min}$ will force the aircraft to turn left.

By applying the appropriate $\theta_{s}$ to the input, the softwalls
algorithm (the path/boundry-interestection algorithm) can garauntee the
plane to never crosses the boundry.
