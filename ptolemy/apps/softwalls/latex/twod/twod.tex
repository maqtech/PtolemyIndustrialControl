\section{Introduction}

This document gives an outline of a general 2D softwalls approach.

\section{Step Bias}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose the aircraft is travelling at a constant speed $s$.  Let
$\theta$ denote the aircraft's heading angle, and let
$\dot{\theta_{p}}$ be the pilot's control input, i.e. the desired rate
of change in heading angle.  At that speed, the aircraft has a
minimum-safe turning radius $r_{min}$.  This contrains the paths at
which the aircraft can bank right or left as in figure \ref{paths}.

\begin{figure}[btp]

\includegraphics[width=5in]{aircraftpaths.eps}
\figcaption{The dot represents the aircraft, which is moving along the
center path.  The circle paths represtent turns at the minimum turning radius.
\label{paths}}
\end{figure}

Now suppose we wish to prevent the aircraft from crossing a boundary,
or entering a no-fly zone.  As the aircraft approaches the boundary,
one of the minimum-turning-radius paths from figure \ref{paths} will
interesect with the boundary.  As long as the other path has not yet
interestected the boundary, the aircraft can still avoid crossing the
boundary by moving along this path.  At the instant the second path
intersects the boundary, forcing the aircraft along the second path
will prevent the aircraft from crossing the boundary.  This situation
is depicted in figure \ref{crossing}.

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{boundarycross.eps}
\figcaption{On the left picture, the aircraft still has one free path.  On the
right picture, the aircraft must move right at the minimum turning
radius to avoid crossing the boundary.
\label{crossing}}
\end{figure}

We can now pose this control algorithm in a more general control
framework.  Let the actual rate of change in aircraft heading angle be
$\dot{\theta}$, and let $\theta_{s}$, be the control signal generated
by the SoftWalls algorithm.  Given the pilot's control signal,
$\dot{\theta_{p}}$, we calculate $\dot{\theta}$ from
\[
\dot{\theta} = limit_{[-s/r_{min}, s/r_{min}]}(\dot{\theta_{p}} -
\dot{\theta_{s}}),
\]
where
\[
\set{limit}_{[a,b]}(u) = \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
b&\mbox{ if } u > b,\\
a&\mbox{ if } u < a,\\
u&\mbox{ otherwise. }
\end{array}
\right .
\]

Assuming $\dot{\theta_{p}}$ is limited to $[-\dot{\theta_{M}},
\dot{\theta_{M}}]$, which corresponds to the limits of the flight
yoke, we can choose $\dot{\theta_{s}} = \dot{\theta_{M}} + s/r_{min}$
to force the aircraft to turn right at the maximum turning radius,
irrespective of pilot input.  Similarly $\dot{\theta_{s}} =
-\dot{\theta_{M}} - s/r_{min}$ will force the aircraft to turn left.
If the left path is the second path to interesect the boundary, the
control signal $\dot{\theta_{s}} = \dot{\theta_{M}} + s/r_{min}$ will
steer the aircraft right, and if the right path is the second to
interestect the boundrary, the control signal $\dot{\theta_{s}} =
-\dot{\theta_{M}} - s/r_{min}$ will steer the aircraft left.  By
applying the appropriate $\theta_{s}$ to the input, the SoftWalls
algorithm (the path/boundary-interestection algorithm) can garauntee
the plane to never crosses the boundary.  This is a step bias, because
the bias is either present or absent.

\section{Smooth Bias}

The method in the previous section opens itself to chatter.  We would
like to increase and decrease the bias smoothly to prevent this
situation (and to make life a little easier on the pilot and passengers).

Around each of the circles in figure \ref{paths}, draw another circle
of radius $r_{o}$ with the same center, as in figure \ref{circles},
where $r_{min} < r_{o} < 3r_{min}$, so that the larger circles do not
encircle both smaller circles.

Let us define a few points to simplify our discussion.  The r-path is
the circular path that a plane would take to go right at the minimum
turning radius.  The r-center is the center of this circle.  We call
the circle of radius $r_{o}$ centered at r-center the r-extension,
because it will be used to extend the region of SoftWalls bias for
smooth control.  Similarly the l-path is the circular path that a
plane would take to go left at the minimum turning radius, which is
centered at l-center and surrounded by l-extension.

Suppose the l-extension crosses the no-fly-zone boundary, but the
r-extension is still outside the no-fly zone.  We do nothing until the
r-extension crosses the boundary.  After the r-extension crosses the
boundary, we still have an escape path, i.e. the r-path, but we would
like to start applying bias.  If the aircraft gets close enough for
the r-path to touch the boundary, we will move along the r-path to
avoid entering the zone.  When the nearest point of the boundaray and
r-center is between the r-extension and the r-path (and the l-extension
has crossed the boundary), we will apply the following bias:
\[
\dot{\theta_{s}} = \frac{d}{r_{o} - r_{min}} (\dot{\theta_{M}} + s/r_{min})
\]
where $d$ is the distance between r-center and the boundary point to
r-center.  We will apply this bias until the l-extension no longer
crosses the boundary.  This will keep the aircraft out of the no-fly
zone while increasing the bias gradually.
