\section{Introduction}

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 proved that airplanes make
deadly weapons.  In response to this attack-by-aircraft threat, Edward
Lee proposed \textit{SoftWalls}, a flight control system that
prevents aircrafts from entering \textit{no-fly zones} \cite{Lee}.  These are
restricted airspaces, such as those near major cities, government
centers, military installations, chemical factories, and nuclear-power
plants.  The major objective of this control scheme is to
minimize the control imposed on pilots while protecting the no-fly
zones.  This control scheme uses a map from the aircraft database
together with position, velocity, and orientation information from
onboard sensors to prevent no-fly zone entry.
 
This document describes our first approach at a SoftWalls control
algorithm.  We assume the aircraft travels in a horizontal plane at a
constant velocity and can only turn.  In this first approach, the
no-fly zone is bounded by a line in the horizontal plane.  While these
approximations are unrealistic, we chose a simple model, which we will
later refine for accuracy.

\section{Two-Dimensional Model}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Two-Dimensional Aircraft Model}

In our two-dimensional model we only control the aircraft heading.
Let the aircraft position be a function
\[
p \colon \rr \to \rr \times \rr
\]
where the domain is time (the reals) and the range is the
two-dimensional aircraft position.  Let $\dot{p}$ denote the time
derivative (the velocity) and $\ddot{p}$ the second derivative with
respect to time (the acceleration). Let $p_x$ denote the $x$-direction
position (east-west, increasing to the east) and $p_y$ the
$y$-direction position (north-south, increasing to the
north). Similarly, $\dot{p_x}$ and $\ddot{p_x}$ denote the
$x$-direction speed and acceleration.

Let the aircraft speed $s$ be given by
\[
\forall ~ t \in \rr, \quad
s(t) = |\dot{p}(t)| .
\]
Let
\[
\theta \colon \rr \to [-\pi, \pi)
\]
be the aircraft heading, where $0$ is due east, so that
\[
\forall ~ t \in \rr, \quad
\dot{p} (t) = (s(t) \cos(\theta (t)), s(t) \sin(\theta(t))) .
\]

Assume that during flight, the pilot controls the rate of change of
heading, $\dot{\theta}$, with differential thrust and movement of the
rudder, ailerons, and elevator.  Moreover, the pilot controls the
speed via overall thrust and vertical movement.  In this model, which
we show in figure \ref{fig2Daircraft}, the the aircraft-model inputs
are $\dot{\theta}$ and $s$.

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{fig2Daircraft.eps}
\figcaption{Two dimensional aircraft model.
\label{fig2Daircraft}}
\end{figure}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Turn Radius}

Assume the speed is a constant $s$, with $s$ given in meters per
second, so the pilot controls only heading.  If the rate of change of
heading is a constant, $\dot{\theta} = \alpha$, with $\alpha$ given in
radians/second, it takes $\tau = 2 \pi /\alpha$ seconds to complete
one circle.  Upon completing the circle, the aircraft has covered a
$s\tau = 2 \pi s/\alpha$ meter distance.  Since the circle radius
times $2 \pi$ gives its circumference, the turning radius is
\[
r = s/\dot{\theta} .
\]

Thus, the rate of change of heading is
\[
\dot{\theta} = s/r.
\]
If we know the minimum-safe-turning radius is $r_{min}$, then the control
signal $\dot{\theta}$ must be kept in the range $[-s/r_{min},
s/r_{min}]$.

For example, an aircraft traveling at
\[
s = 500~ kilometers/hour
\]
(139 meters/second) with a minimum safe turning radius $r_{min} =
1000$ meters constrains the pilot's safe $\dot{\theta}$ to the range
$[-0.139, 0.139]$ radians per second.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Blending Controller}

Let the pilot's control signal be $\dot{\theta}_p$ and the
SoftWalls-generated control signal be $\dot{\theta}_s$.  We take the
rate of change of aircraft heading to be
\[
\dot{\theta} = \set{limit}_{[-s/r_{min}, s/r_{min}]}
(\dot{\theta}_p - \dot{\theta}_s ),
\]
where $\set{limit}_{[a,b]}$ is a function
\[
\set{limit}_{[a,b]} \colon \rr \to [a, b]
\]
where
\[
\forall ~ u \in \rr, \quad
\set{limit}_{[a,b]}(u) = \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
b&\mbox{ if } u > b,\\
a&\mbox{ if } u < a,\\
u&\mbox{ otherwise. }
\end{array}
\right .
\]
This strategy blends the SoftWalls and pilot control signals ensuring
that as long as the control parameter is within safe limits, the
aircraft response to the pilot's control signal remains unattenuated.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Maintaining Responsiveness}

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics{bias.eps}
\figcaption{Actual rate of change of heading vs. pilot-specified rate of
change of heading.  Here, a left turn is on the right side of the
graph because a positive $d\theta/dt$ will cause the aircraft to turn
left.  Note that $M$ is the maximum-safe $d\theta/dt$.
\label{figBias}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figBias} illustrates the blending controller maintaining
responsiveness while biasing the pilot control.  When the SoftWalls
controller adds no bias, the aircraft will turn as the pilot
intends. That is, the actual $\dot{\theta}$ equals the pilot's
$\dot{\theta}_{p}$.  Suppose the SoftWalls bias is $-M = -s/r_{min}$,
where $M$ is the maximum rate of change in heading.  The bias is
rightward, and the pilot will be unable to turn the aircraft left.
If the pilot attempts to turn left at the maximum rate $M$, the
aircraft will keep straight.  When the bias increases to $-3M/2$, also
rightward, the aircraft will turn right at a rate greater than or
equal to $-M/2$ for any pilot control signal.

With this scheme, a cooperative pilot will turn away from the soft
wall to reduce the bias.  An uncooperative pilot, however, will
attempt a turn towards the wall even with the bias applied.  When the
bias exceeds $-M$, this pilot will be unable to overcome the bias, and
with the controls saturated, the aircraft will turn away from the soft
wall.

Until the actual $\dot{\theta}$ saturates, the aircraft responds
exactly as the pilot expects.  That is, when the slope of the response
curve (figure \ref{figBias}) is not zero, it is one.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Criticality-Based Control}

To asses the threat an aircraft poses to a no-fly zone, we created a
criticallity measurement.  From this we compute the bias, $\theta_s$,
if any.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{A Measure of Criticality}

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics{criticality.eps}
\figcaption{Calculating $T(x,\,\theta)$ for criticality measure.
\label{figCriticality}}
\end{figure}

Our criticality measurement is inversely proportional to the minimum
time it takes the aircraft to enter the no-fly zone.  Figure
\ref{figCriticality} illustrates this measure.  In this figure, the
black dots represent the aircraft position, and the arrows represent
its heading. For each position and heading, we plot the worst-case
trajectory, i.e., the path that takes the aircraft into the
no-fly zone faster than all other paths, as dotted lines.  In this
sense, we are calculating an optimal path for the aircraft to collide with
the no-fly zone.

Suppose we define the no-fly zone as the regioin $\{(x,y)|\ x \geq b_{x}\}$. Then the
criticality measurement, $c$, and the aircraft $y$-position are
independent. We let  $c(x, \theta) = 1 / T(x, \theta)$ where
$T(x, \theta)$, the minimum time a aircraft needs to contact the no-fly
zone.  Here
\begin{equation}
T(x, \theta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\frac{\theta}{M} + \frac{d - r_{min}\sin{\theta}}{s} & \mbox{if $d \geq r_{min}\sin{\theta},\ 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2$} \\
\frac{\theta - \arcsin{\left( \frac{r_{min}\sin{\theta}- d}{r_{min}}\right) }}{M} & \mbox{if $d < r_{min}\sin{\theta},\ 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2$} \\
\frac{2(\theta - \pi/2)}{M} + T(x, \pi - \theta) & \mbox{if $\pi/2 < \theta \leq \pi$} \\
T(x, |\theta|) & \mbox{if $-\pi \leq \theta < 0$}
\end{array}
\right. \label{eq:bigT}
\end{equation}
where $d = b_{x} - x$ is the distance between the aircraft and the no-fly zone.
Note that $s$, $r_{min}$, and $M$ are related by $M = s/r_{min}$.

Note also that if the aircraft is at the wall and heading directly
away from it, as in the top diagram of figure \ref{figCriticality},
then the minimum time for aircraft/no-fly zone collision is the time
required to traverse a semi-circle with radius $r_{min}$.  This is
$\pi/M$.  If the aircraft is at distance $d$ from the wall and heading
straight towards it, then the minimum time is $d/s$, where $s$ is the
(constant) speed.  If the aircraft is at distance $d$ from the wall
(greater than $r_{min}$) but heading parallel to it, then the time it
will take to reach the wall is
\[
T = \pi M/2+(d-r_{min})/s .
\]

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Criticality-Based SoftWall Controller}

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics{criticalityBias.eps}
\figcaption{Bias as a function of criticality.
\label{figCriticalityBias}}
\end{figure}

Our criticality-based controller produces the bias shown in figure
\ref{figCriticalityBias}.  The threshold $M/\pi$ is the value of $c(x,
\theta)$ when $x = b_{x}$ (the aircraft is on the boundary of the
no-fly zone), and $\theta = \pi$ (the aircraft is flying straight out
of the no-fly zone). No bias is needed here, nor for smaller
criticality.  The threshold $M/2$ is equal to $c(b_{x}-2r_{min}, 0)$
-- the aircraft is flying straight towards the no-fly zone at a
distance of $2r_{min}$ from the zone.  The aircraft can still safely
turn away at half the maximum turning rate. Note that the maximum bias
level is at $3M/2$, so this bias turns the aircraft at a rate of at
least half the maximum rate, irrespective of pilot input. The bias
sign convention is the same as $\theta$ (positive -- left, negative --
right).

\subsection{Simulation Results}

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics{pilotControl.eps}
\figcaption{Pilot control as a function of heading for the maximally
uncooperative pilot.
\label{figPilotControl}}
\end{figure}

We constructed the model of figure \ref{figCriticalityTopLevel} with
Ptolemy II to simulate the proposed controller. The \emph{aircraft
dynamics} component contains the aircraft model of figure
\ref{fig2Daircraft}. The \emph{malicious pilot} component implements
the control strategy of figure \ref{figMaliciousPilot}. Here, the
pilot tries to fly the aircraft into the no-fly zone by maintaining
the heading $\theta$ at 0. This is accomplished by multiplying the
heading by a large number and limiting the result to a number in the
safe-control range.  Intuitively, the pilot will attempt to turn
maximally towards the wall whenever the current heading deviates from
the heading directly towards the wall, as shown in figure
\ref{figPilotControl}.  When the aircraft is approaching the wall, this
pilot does not try to turn.  The nonzero slope near $\theta = 0$
prevents the system from exhibiting Zeno behavior.  The
\emph{criticality} component calculates $c(x, \theta)$. The \emph{bias
control} component implements the SoftWall controller. The output
from the pilot and the controller are combined and limited to the
range $[-M, M]$ before fed back to the aircraft model.

\begin{figure}[btp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{simulationRun.eps}
\figcaption{Simulation run with a maximally
uncooperative pilot.
\label{figSimulationRun}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figSimulationRun} shows a simulation run.  In our
simulation the aircraft initially flies parallel to the no-fly zone
($\theta = \pi / 2$), at a distance of 2 miles. The aircraft speed is
a constant 360 miles per hour. The maximum turning rate is $2\pi/20$,
so that the aircraft can complete a circle in 20 seconds. (Note that
these numbers are fictional. Later simulations will use real
aircraft-performance characteristics.)

The aircraft starts at the lower left, traveling parallel to the
no-fly zone, which is two miles right of the aircraft.  Initially, the
malicious pilot freely turns the aircraft toward the no-fly zone. When
the aircraft is within 1 mile from the zone, the controller starts
biasing the pilot control. Before the bias control reaches $M$, the
pilot mitigates the bias and keeps the aircraft heading toward the
no-fly zone.  The pilot control finally saturates when $\theta_{s} =
M$, and the SoftWall controller turns the aircraft around at half the
maximum rate. As the criticality decreases, the bias from the
controller becomes smaller. The pilot regains steerage towards the
no-fly zone, but the aircraft settles in, flying parallel to the
zone. At this time, the pilot is still trying in vain to fly the
aircraft into the no-fly zone by placing the control maximally right.

We are still improving this criticality-based control scheme. At
present, we are simulating a variety of flight scenarios, and
investigating interactive simulations where experimenters control the
pilot's output.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Criticality-Based Control Verification}

\subsubsection{Validity of the Criticality Measure}

The trajectories we use to calculate $T(x,\ \theta)$ are illustrated
in figure~\ref{figCriticality}. Such trajectories are achieved by
first turning the aircraft at the maximum rate, $M$, towards the
no-fly zone.  The aircraft then maintains that direction until hitting
the no-fly zone. In the following we argue that such trajectories
indeed yield the shortest time to reach the no-fly zone.

Let $\dot{x}(t)$ denote the aircraft velocity in the direction
perpendicular to the wall, and let $\theta(t)$ denote the aircraft
heading.  From our aircraft model, where $s$ is the constant aircraft
speed,
\[
\dot{x}(t) = s \cos{(\int_{0}^{t}{\dot{\theta}}(\hat{t})d\hat{t})}
\]
Here $\dot{\theta}(t)$ is the rate of change of heading.  When the
SoftWalls system applies no bias, this signal equals the pilot input.
$\theta$ is always in the range $[-s / r_{min}, s / r_{min}]$.

When $x(t) < b_{x}$, i.e., the aircraft is left of the no-fly zone,
the aircraft approaches the no-fly zone faster as $\dot{x}(t)$
increases.  The maximum value of $\dot{x}(t)$ is $s$.  If $\theta(t) =
0$, then $\dot{x}(t) = s$, so an input of $\dot{\theta}(t) = 0$ will
cause the aircraft to move to the wall the fastest.  When $\theta(t)
\neq 0$, as $\theta(t) \rightarrow 0, \dot{x}(t) \rightarrow s$.  For
$\theta(t) \in (0,\pi]$, the fastest way to make $x(t) \rightarrow s$
is to set $\dot{\theta}(t) = -M$, where $M$ is the maximum turning
rate.  In this range of angles, $\dot{x}(t)$ will be strictly
increasing at the maximum rate, so this is the fastest approach to the
wall.  Similarly, when $\theta(t) \in (-\pi, 0)$, the fastest approach
to the wall uses $\dot{\theta}(t) = M$ until $\theta(t) = 0$.  The
criticality measure uses this strategy to calculate the minimum time
for aircraft/no-fly zone collision, so it is a valid minimum-time
calculation.

\subsubsection{Safety of Criticality-Based Control}

We assume that the initial position of the aircraft is at least
$2r_{min}$ from the no-fly zone. With the criticality-based control
strategy discussed earlier in this section, we show that the aircraft
cannot enter the no-fly zone, even if the pilot tries to.

At the initial position, the criticality $c \leq M/\,2$. Because $c$ is a
continuous function of $x$ and $\theta$, along any potential trajectory from
the initial position to the no-fly zone, there must be a point where
$c(x,\ \theta) = M/\,2$. The pair $x,\ \theta$ satisfying this equation is
related by
\[x = 
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
b_x - r_{min}(2 + \sin\!|\,\theta| - |\,\theta|) & |\,\theta| \leq 2 
\\
b_x - r_{min}(\sin\!|\,\theta| - \sin(|\,\theta|-2)) & 2 < |\,\theta| \leq \pi/\,2 + 1
\end{array}
\right.
\]
$c(x,\ \theta)$ is always less than $M/\,2$ when $|\,\theta| > \pi/\,2 + 1$.

If a malicious pilot wants to fly the aircraft from a point where 
$c(x,\ \theta) = M/\,2$ into the no-fly zone, the pilot has to prevent the
criticality from decreasing to a value less than $M/\,2$. Given the bias added
by our control strategy, the aircraft will be turned away from the no-fly zone
at a minimum rate of $M/\,2$ when $c(x,\ \theta) \geq M/\,2$. Starting at a
point where $c(x,\ \theta) = M/\,2$, the maximum $x$-coordinate that the
aircraft can reach is given by
\[x_{max} = 
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
b_{x} - r_{min}(3\sin\!|\,\theta| - |\,\theta|) & |\,\theta| \leq \pi/\,2
\\
b_{x} - r_{min}(2 + \sin\!|\,\theta| - |\,\theta|) & \pi/\,2 < |\,\theta| \leq 2
\\
b_{x} - r_{min}(\sin\!|\,\theta| - \sin(|\,\theta|-2)) & 2 < |\,\theta| \leq \pi/\,2 + 1
\end{array}
\right.
\]
$x_{max}$ is never greater than $b_x$, so the aircraft is never inside the
no-fly zone.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Summary}

We have described a simple control algorithm to keep an aircraft out
of a no-fly zone.  Our test zone is bounded by a straight line in two
dimensions.  Our strategy maintains maximal responsiveness to pilot
controls subject to the constraint that we forbid no-fly zone entry.
