This directory was created to allows to keep up with code changes.

Theme:
* Learn FreeRTOS
* Port P1000 Ptides or do it from Scratch using the FreeRTOS.
* Remove the dependency on the RTOS (save a copy of the RTOS version for testing)
  and implement the scheduler
   - Is there any improvement over the RTOS version? (We can try different 
   scheduling mechanism EDF, etc)
* Run a few tests
  * We can make a few examples that explore what Ptides offers specifically
  * The we can port Benchmarks like PapaBence to Ptides so that we have a set of general
    benchmarks
  * I'm (Shanna) going to email Stefan Resmerita from Toyota to ask if we could get a few 
  traces from them (this probably isn't the most promising since companies are very protective
  of their IP). (fingers crossed just in case)
  
  
Infrastructure Setup:
1.   will finish later
