/**
A request to link a port to a relation.  When this request is executed, if
the container of the port implements the Actor interface, then both
the schedule and the type resolution are invalidated, forcing them to
be recomputed when they are next needed. In addition,
if the port is an IOPort and is also an input, then this method calls its
createReceivers() method.  Notice that will result in the loss of any
data that might be present in the port.  In addition, if the port is
an output port, then createReceivers() is called on all deeply connected
input ports.  This may again result in loss of data.  Notice that this
could make this class difficult to use deterministically.
