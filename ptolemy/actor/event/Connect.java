/**
A request to connect two ports.  When this request is executed, if
the container of either port implements the Actor interface, then both
the schedule and the type resolution are invalidated, forcing them to
be recomputed at the next opportunity. In addition,
if either port is an IOPort and is also an input, then this method calls its
createReceivers() method.  Notice that will result in the loss of any
data that might be present in the port.
