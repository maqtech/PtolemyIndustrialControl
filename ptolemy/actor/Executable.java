/**
   This interface defines the <i>action methods</i>, which determine
   how an object can be invoked. It should be implemented by actors
   and directors. In an execution of an application,
   the preinitialize() and initialize() methods should be
   invoked exactly once, followed by any number of iterations, followed
   by exactly one invocation of the wrapup() method. An <i>iteration</i>
   is defined to be one firing of the prefire() method, followed by
   any number of firings of the fire() method, followed by one firing
   of the postfire() method.
   The prefire() method returns true to indicate that firing
   can occur.  The postfire() method returns false if no further firings
   should occur. The initialize(), fire() and postfire() methods may produce
   output data.  The initialize() method runs after the topology has
   stabilized (all higher-order function actors have executed) and
   type resolution has been done.  The preinitialize() method runs
   before these have happened.
