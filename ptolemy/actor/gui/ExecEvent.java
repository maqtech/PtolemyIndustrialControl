//// ExecEvent
/**
An event that indicates that an actor is in a particular state.
The event contains two pieces of information:  the actor that
generated the event and the (integer) state of the actor when
the event was generated. A class that listens for ExecEvents
must implement the ExecEventListener interface. 

The interpretation of state is determined by the actors and 
listeners that use the ExecEvent class and ExecEventListener
interface. The author of code that takes advantage of these
facilities should write the actors and listeners so that they 
utilize a common meaning for the integer states.
