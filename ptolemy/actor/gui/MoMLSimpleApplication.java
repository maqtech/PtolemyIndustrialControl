/** A simple application that reads in a .xml file as a command
line argument and runs it.

<p>MoMLApplication sets the look and feel, which starts up Swing,
so we can't use MoMLApplication for non-graphical simulations.

<p>We implement the ChangeListener interface so that this
class will get exceptions thrown by failed change requests.

For example to use this class, try:
<pre>
java -classpath $PTII ptolemy.actor.gui.MoMLSimpleApplication ../../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/OrthogonalCom/OrthogonalCom.xml
</pre>
