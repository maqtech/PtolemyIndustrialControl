/**
An ExecEventListener is a listener for ExecEvents created by actors.
In general, an object that implements this interface will probably be
a front end such as a execution visualization tool for the Ptolemy
II system, or an object that is communicating with a front end. The
events are issued only when the event actually occurs, not when it
is requested.
