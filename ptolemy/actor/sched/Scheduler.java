//// Scheduler
/**
The base class for schedulers. A scheduler schedules the execution order
of the containees of a CompositeActor.
<p>
A scheduler has a reference to a StaticSchedulingDirector, and
provides the schedule for it.
The director will use this schedule to govern the execution of a
CompositeActor.
<p>
 A schedule is simply a
collection of objects. It could be the firing order of actors in a
particular composite actor, and it also could consist of sub-schedules,
each of which is another collection. We leave for the director to
interpret what a schedule means. In this base class, the default schedule
is an Enumeration of deep contained actors in their construction order.
<P>
The schedule, once constructed, is cached and reused in the next time
if the schedule is still valid. The validation of a schedule is set by
the setValid() method. If the current schedule is set to be not valid,
the schedule() method will call the protected _schedule() method to
reconstruct it. The _schedule() method is the place
the scheduling algorithm goes, and the derived class should override it.
<p>
Scheduler does perform any mutations, and it is not a topology change
listener. The director who uses this scheduler should set the validation
flag accordingly when mutations occur.
