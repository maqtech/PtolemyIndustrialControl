//// StaticSchedulingDirector
/**
A director that uses static scheduling to govern the execution of the
CompositeActor it belongs to.
<p>
A StaticSchedulingDirector contains a scheduler. By calling the schedule()
method on the scheduler, the director can get an Enumeration of the
actors in the firing order. Then the director can use this Enumeration
to fire the actors in that order.
<p>
"Static" means that the schedule, once constructed, can be
used during the execution repeatedly.
So the schedule is locally cached in the scheduler, and can be reused
when needed. A schedule is called "valid" if is can be used to correctly
direct the execution of the CompositeActor.
However, the schedule may become invalid when the CompositeActor mutates.
The scheduler is a TopologyListener of the director, and the schedule
is automatically invalidated when a TopologyChange occurs.
The setScheduleValid() method can also be used to explicitly validate
or invalidate the schedule when needed.
