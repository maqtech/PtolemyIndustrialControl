//// CompositeActor
/**
A CompositeActor is an aggregation of actors.  It may have a
<i>local director</i>, which is an object of class Director that
is responsible for executing the contained actors.
Normally, at the top level of a hierarchy, a composite actor with no
container will have a local director.  A composite actor at a lower level
of the hierarchy may also have a local director.  A composite actor
with a local director is <i>opaque</i>, and serves the role of the
<i>wormhole</i> from Ptolemy 0.x. Its ports are opaque, but it can
contain actors and relations.
<p>
The getDirector() method returns the local director if there is one.
Otherwise, it returns the <i>executive director</i>, if there is one.
Whatever it returns is called (simply) the <i>director</i> of the
composite (it may be local or executive).
<p>
The <i>executive director</i>, is simply the director of the container,
if it has one.  If there is no container (the composite is at the top
level of the hierarchy), then an executive director can be explicitly
specified using the setExecutiveDirector() method.  Such an executive
director implements the master controller for execution of an application.
It may, for example, be associated with a control panel user interface.
It is responsible for invoking the director.
<p>
A composite actor must have a director in order to be executable.
In fact, it cannot even receive data in its input ports without a director,
since the director is responsible for supplying the receivers to the ports.
If the getDirector() method returns null, then the composite is not
executable.
<p>
If there is no director, then the executive director plays the role
of director.  I.e., for the purposes of execution, the hierarchy is
flattened.  The executive director executes the composite by executing
the contained actors. If there is a director, then the executive director
executes this composite by issuing commands to the director.
<p>
When a composite actor has both a director and an executive director, then
the model of computation implemented by the director need not be the
same as the model of computation implemented by the executive director.
This is the source of the hierarchical heterogeneity in Ptolemy II.
Multiple models of computation can be cleanly nested.
<p>
The ports of a CompositeActor are constrained to be IOPorts, the
relations to be IORelations, and the actors to be instances of
ComponentEntity that implement the Actor interface.  Derived classes
may impose further constraints by overriding newPort(), _addPort(),
newRelation(), _addRelation(), and _addEntity().
<p>
The container is constrained to be an instance of CompositeActor.
Derived classes may impose further constraints by overriding setContainer().
