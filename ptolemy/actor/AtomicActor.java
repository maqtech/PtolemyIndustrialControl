//// AtomicActor
/**
An AtomicActor is an executable entity that cannot itself contain
other actors. The container is required to be an instance of CompositeActor.
Derived classes may further constrain the container by overriding
setContainer(). The Ports of AtomicActors are constrained to be IOPorts.
Derived classes may further constrain the ports by overriding the public
method newPort() to create a port of the appropriate subclass, and the
protected method _addPort() to throw an exception if its argument is a
port that is not of the appropriate subclass. In this base class, the
actor does nothing in the action methods (prefire, fire, ...).
