//// MultiplyDivide
/**
A polymorphic multiplier and/or divider.
This adder has two input ports, both of which are multiports,
and one output port, which is not.
The types on the ports are undeclared and will be resolved by
the type resolution mechanism. Data that arrives on the
input port named <i>multiply</i> will be multiplied, and data that arrives
on the input port named <i>divide</i> will be divided.
Any token type supporting multiplication and division can be used.
In most domains, either input port can be left unconnected.
Thus, to get a simple multiplier (with no division), just leave the
<i>divide</i> input unconnected.
<p>
Currently, the type system is quite liberal about the resolved
types it will permit at the inputs. In particular, it may permit the
<i>multiply</i> and <i>divide</i> inputs to resolve to types that cannot
in fact be multiplied or divided.  In these cases, a run-time error will occur.
In the future, we hope that the type system will intercept such errors
before run time.
<p>
This actor is not strict. That is, it does not require that each input
channel have a token upon firing. It will multiply or divide available
tokens at the inputs and ignore the channels that do not have tokens.
It consumes at most one input token from each port.
If no input tokens are available on the <i>multiply</i> inputs,
then a numerator of one is assumed for the division operations.
The "one" is obtained by calling the one() method of the first
token seen at the <i>divide</i> input.
If no input tokens are available at all, then no output is produced.
