Here are some tips for setting up and run Jini and JavaSpaces

1) You must set your environment variable $PTII properly. 

2) To bring up Jini, you may run script "${PTII}/bin/ptstartjini"
   You do not need to have your own jini1_0_1 package installed. It is 
   part of the ptII tree, under vendors/sun/jini/jini1_0_1 

3) Stub files are automatically generated by makefile, so you 
   don't need to run rmic separately.

4) In the current implememtation, entries write into the 
JavaSpace stay there for ever. You may want to use the script
util/cleanspace to remove all entries from the space. This is
usually between to runs of a demo.
