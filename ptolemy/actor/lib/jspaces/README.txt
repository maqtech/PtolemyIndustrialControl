Here are some tips for setting up and run Jini and JavaSpaces

1) You must set your environment variable $PTII properly.

2) Install Jini in $PTII/vendors/sun/jini/jini1_0_1
   so that $PTII/vendors/sun/jini/jini1_0_1/lib/jini_core.jar exists

   If Jini is elsewhere, you can try running configure with
   configure --with-jini=

3) To bring up Jini, you run
   ${PTII}/bin/ptstartjini

   You may need to make the following changes via the
   Software Services Startup gui:

   * Txn Manager: If you are under windows, you may need t
   change Location of Txn Log Directory from \tmp\txn_log to c:\tmp\txn_log

   * RMI Activation: You may need to add the Policy file to
   the Optional Switches.  Change c:\users\yourname to the value of ptII
   -J-Djava.security.policy=c:\users\yourname\ptII\policy.all

   * Registry Services: Check RMI Registry

4) Stub files are automatically generated by makefile, so you
   don't need to run rmic separately.

5) In the current implememtation, entries write into the
   JavaSpace stay there for ever. You may want to use the script
   util/cleanspace to remove all entries from the space. This is
   usually between to runs of a demo.
