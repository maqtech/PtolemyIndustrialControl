Here are some tips for setup and run Jini and JavaSpaces

1) You must set your environment variable $PTII properly. 

2) To bring up Jini, you may run script "util/startjini.gui"
   You must have your own jini1_0_1 package installed. It is not
   part of the Ptolemy distribution. 

3) After make, we also need to generator the Stub and Skeletons for
remote classes. In this directory, we also need to manually do:

rmic -classpath ${PTII}:${PTII}/vendors/sun/jini/lib/jini-jspaces.jar ptolemy.actor.lib.jspaces.Subscriber

4) In the current implememtation, entries write into the 
JavaSpace stay there for ever. You may want to use the script
util/cleanspace to remove all entries from the space. This is
usually between to runs of a demo.
