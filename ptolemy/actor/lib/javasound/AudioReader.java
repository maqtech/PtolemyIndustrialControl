/**
This actor sequentially outputs the samples from an sound file,
specified as a URL. Although the sound file must be specified
as a URL, it is still possible to specify files on the local
file system. The audio samples that are read from the file are
converted to DoubleTokens that may range from [-1.0, 1.0].
Thus, the output type of this actor is DoubleToken.
<p>
<b>Usage</b>
<p>
The <i>sourceURL</i> parameter should be set to the name of the file,
specified as a fully qualified URL. It is possible to load a file
from the local file system by using the prefix "file://" instead of
"http://". Relative file paths are allowed. To specify a file
relative to the current directory, use "../" or "./". For example,
if the current directory contains a file called "test.wav", then
<i>sourceURL</i> should be set to "file:./test.wav". If the parent
directory contains a file called "test.wav", then <i>sourceURL</i>
should be set to "file:../test.wav". To reference the file
test.wav, located at "/tmp/test.wav", <i>sourceURL</i>
should be set to "file:///tmp/test.wav" The default value is
<code>"file:///"
 + property("ptolemy.ptII.dir")
 + "/ptolemy/actor/lib/javasound/test/voice.wav"
</code>
Under Windows, to reference a file ":\WINNT\Media\chord.wav, use
"file:///c:/WINNT/Media/chord.wav".  Note that URLS by definition
have forward slashes, not backward slashes.
<p>
Supported file formats are  WAV, AU, and AIFF. The sound
file format is determined from the file extension.
<p>
The sound file is not periodically repeated by this actor, so
postfire() will return false when the end of the sound
file is reached.
<p>
There are security issues involved with accessing files and audio
resources in applets. Applets are only allowed access to files
specified by a URL and located on the machine from which the
applet is loaded. The .java.policy file may be modified to grant
applets more privileges.
<p>
Note: Requires Java 2 v1.3.0 or later.
