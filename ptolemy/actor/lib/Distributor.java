/**
The actor reads tokens from its input stream and redirects those tokens to
the different relations connected to the output port in a cyclic way.
This actor is a polymorphic actor and should work with most of the domains.
It reads a token from the input stream and writes a token to an output
relation. On reading the next token from the input, it sends this token to the
next relation. The order of the relations on the output side is the order
of their creation.

This actor can handle mutations of some types.
The smallest granularity of mutations that this can handle are the mutations
that can occur between every read from the input channel.

In case of domains like SDF, which need to know the token consumption or
production rate for all ports before they can construct a firing schedule,
this actor defines and sets three different port parameters, namely:
<UL>
<LI>Token Consumption Rate
<LI>Token Production Rate
<LI>TokenInitProduction
</UL>
These parameters can be ignored by domains that do not require this information.

These parameters are safe for computing a schedule only after a call to the
initialize() method of the actor, as they are computed and set in that method.
