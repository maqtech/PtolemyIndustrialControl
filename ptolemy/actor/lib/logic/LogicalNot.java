/**
A polymorphic logical NOT operator.
This adder has one input port and one output port, 
neither of which are multiports.
For now, the type of the input port is limited to 
BooleanToken, until a standard for handling non-booleans is 
resolved.  A BooleanToken that arrives in the <i>input</i> 
will be negated and passed to the <i>output</i> port for broadcasting.
If no input token is available at all, then no output is produced.
