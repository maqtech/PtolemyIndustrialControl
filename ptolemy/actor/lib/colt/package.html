Classes that use the Colt package to generate random numbers.
<p>
 <br>Colt is an
"Open Source Libraries for High Performance
Scientific and Technical Computing in Java"

These classes use the Colt library from
<a href="http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/" target="_top"><CODE>http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/</CODE></a>

<p>To use these classes, download colt and unjar so 
that $PTII/vendors/misc/colt/colt.jar is created
<pre>
cd $PTII/vendors/misc
mkdir colt
jar -xf /tmp/colt1.0.3.zip
</pre>
 <p><CODE>colt.xml</CODE> should be added to
<CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/configs/defaultFullConfiguration.xml</CODE>
(Eventually, after it has been cleaned up,
colt.xml might go in with the Random numbers)
