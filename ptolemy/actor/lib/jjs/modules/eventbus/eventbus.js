/**
 * Module supporting publishing and subscribing on the Vert.x event bus.
 * This module provides an interface to the Vert.x event bus, which
 * supports a peer-to-peer publish-and-subscribe network on a local
 * area network. Upon invoking the VertxBus constructor in this module,
 * the host running this module participates in the pub-sub network.
 * The pub-sub network extends as far as multicast packets extend
 * in the local-area network, and other participants will be automatically
 * discovered. Hence, you can publish events on the local network or
 * subscribe to events on the local network using this module.
 * <p>
 * Events are published with an address, which is an arbitrary string
 * that identifies the event or stream of events. This address could
 * indicate the topic of message. A network or service using this pub-sub
 * mechanism should develop a convention for these addresses to minimize
 * accidental name collisions. For example, a sensor might publish
 * sensor data using an address like 'org.terraswarm.sensor.accelerometer.onShoe'.
 * <p>
 * The published data can be any JavaScript object that has a string
 * JSON representation (using JSON.stringify()). 
 * <p>
 * If the host has more than one network interface (e.g. WiFi and wired),
 * then the one to use can be specified by name as an optional argument
 * to the constructor. You can also specify the port to use, though if
 * you do, then you are responsible for avoiding port collisions.
 * The default network interface used is whichever one is represented by
 * 'localhost'. The default port is an arbitrary unused port.

var EventBusHelper = Java.type('ptolemy.actor.lib.jjs.modules.eventbus.EventBusHelper');
var events = require('events');

/** Construct an interface to the Vert.x bus. Use this as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *     var eventbus = require('eventbus');
 *     var bus = new eventbus.VertxBus();
 *     bus.subscribe('topic');
 *     bus.on('topic', 
 *      function(msg) {
 *        print(msg);
 *      }
 *     );
 *     bus.publish('topic', {'hello':'world'});
 *  </pre>
 *  This creates an interface to the event bus, subscribes to events
 *  with address 'topic', provides a handler for such events,
 *  and publishes a single event to that same address.
 *  The result should be to print:
 *  <pre>
 *    {'hello':'world'}
 *  </pre>
 *  on the standard output.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses the event emitter pattern common in JavaScript.
 *  Once you have subscribed to an address, you can specify any number of
 *  handlers as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.on(address, function);
 *  </pre>
 *  To give a handler that reacts only to exactly one event with this address, use
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.once(address, function);
 *  </pre>
 *  To unsubscribe to an address, use
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.unsubscribe(address);
 *  </pre>
 *  To unsubscribe to all addresses, use
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.unsubscribe();
 *  </pre>
 *  In addition, this module supports point-to-point communication, which sends an event
 *  to exactly one subscriber, chosen in a approximately round-robin fashion. To send
 *  to exactly one subscriber, instead of '''publish''' use '''send''', as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.send('topic', {'hello':'world'});
 *  </pre>
 *  When sending a point-to-point message, it is possible to get a reply from the
 *  recipient.  The recipient (which also uses this module) should set the reply message
 *  as in the following example:
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.setReply('confirmed');
 *  </pre>
 *  where 'confirmed' can be replaced with any string or value that has a JSON string representation.
 *  The sender can then specify a handler to receive the reply as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *     bus.send('topic', {'hello':'world'}, handler);
 *  </pre>
 *  where handler is a function that takes one argument, the reply message.
 *  @constructor
 *  @param options A JSON record containing optional fields 'port' (an int)
 *   and 'host' (a string). These specify the network interface on the local host
 *   to use to connect to the Vert.x event bus cluster. This defaults to
 *   \{'host':'localhost', 'port':0\}, where a port value of 0 means "find
 *   an open port and use that. If no options parameter is given, then use
 *   the defaults.
