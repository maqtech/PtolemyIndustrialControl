/**
Base class for time-based sources.  A time-based source is
a source where the output value is a function of current time.
For some sequence-based domains, such as SDF, actors of this type
probably do not make sense because current time is not incremented.
This actor has a parameter, <i>stopTime</i>, that optionally controls
the duration for which the actor is fired.  If this number is
<i>t</i> > 0.0, then when current time reaches <i>t</i>,
postfire() returns false. This indicates
to the director that this actor should not be invoked again.
The default value of <i>stopTime</i> is 0.0, which results in postfire
always returning true.  In other words, this makes the lifetime
infinite. Derived classes must call super.postfire() for this mechanism to
work.
