/**
Base class for simple data sources.  This class provides an output port
and a trigger input port, both exposed as public variables.  The trigger
port is a multiport of type Token, meaning that you can connect anything
to it without imposing any type constraints on what you connect to it.
The purpose of the trigger input is to (optionally) supply events that
cause the actor to fire.  For some domains, such as SDF and CT, this is
entirely unnecessary, as the actor will fire whether inputs are supplied
or not.  In such domains, the trigger input will normally be left unconnected.
Some derived classes may attach additional significance to an input
on the trigger port.  In this base class, the fire() method reads
at most one token from each channel of the trigger input, if any,
and then discards the token.
