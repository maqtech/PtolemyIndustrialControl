/**
This is a marker interface for actors that operate on sequences.
That is, logically, all signals observed or produced are sequences
of tokens, where time is not significant, but the
indexing of the token within the sequence may be.
Actors that implement this marker interface may be disallowed
in certain domains, like CT, where the number of tokens per
unit time is unpredictable, and out of the control of the actor.
