//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Expression
/**
On each firing, evaluate an expression that may include references
to the inputs, current time, and a count of the firing.  The ports are
referenced by the variables that have the same name as the port.
To use this class, instantiate it, then add ports (instances of TypedIOPort).
The type is polymorphic, with the only constraint that the
types of the inputs must all be less than (in the type order)
the type of the output.  What this means (loosely) is that
the types of the input tokens can be converted losslessly into
tokens with the type of the output.
<p>
The <i>expression</i> parameter should be set using its
setExpression() method.  By default, it is empty, and attempting
to execute the actor without setting it triggers an exception.
<p>
The expression language understood by this actor is documented
in the Data chapter of the Ptolemy II design document.
The expressions evaluated by this actor can refer to the current
time by the variable name "time" and to the current iteration count
by the variable named "iteration."
<p>
This actor could be used instead of many of the arithmetic actors,
such as AddSubtract, MultiplyDivide, and Sine.  However, those actors
will be more efficient, and sometimes more convenient to use.
<p>
NOTE: There are a number of limitations in the current implementation.
First, the type constraints on the ports are the default, that input
ports must have type that be losslessly converted to the type of the
output.  The type constraints have nothing to do with the expression.
This is a severe limitation, but removing it depends on certain
extensions to the Ptolemy II type system which are in progress.
Second, multiports are not supported. Also, if name duplications occur,
for example if a parameter and a port have the same name, then
the results are unpredictable.  They will depend on the order
in which things are defined, which may not be the same in the
constructor as in the clone method.  This class attempts to
detect name duplications and throw an exception.
