//// Manager
/**
A Manager is a domain-independent object that manages the execution of
a model.   It provides several methods to control execution with: run()
startRun(), pause(), resume(), terminate(), and finish().
Most often, methods in this object will be called by a
graphical user interface.  However, it is possible to manually call
these methods from a java object, a java applet, or an interactive
prompt, such as Tcl Blend.
Because user interaction will likely be occurring asynchronously to the
execution of the model, it is important that all the processing for the
model occur in a separate thread.   The Manager is responsible for creating
and managing the Java thread in which execution begins, although some
domains may spawn additional threads of their own.
<p>
Note that the Manager class implements the Runnable interface with the run()
method implements the execution of the model. The run() method call is a
blocking method call, in the sense that the flow of execution will be returned
to the caller only after the run() method finishes. On the other hand, the
startRun() method call is a non-blocking method call. It creates a separate
thread running the execution and the flow of execution will be returned
immediately to the caller.
<p>
Manager also tries to optimize the simulation by making the workspace
<i>write-protected</i> during the iteration period when all the
directors 'agree'.
Calling getReadAccess() and doneReading() on a <i>write-protected</i>
workspace will return immediately (No writer, no problem). On the other hand,
calling getWriteAccess() and doneWriting() on a <i>write-protected</i>
workspace will result in an exception being thrown, so don't write-protect the
workspace if write access will ever be needed. A domain-specific director, by
default, will not 'agree' to have the workspace write-protected. To override
the default behaviour, override the Director._writeAccessPreference() method.
