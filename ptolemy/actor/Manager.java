//// Manager
/**
A Manager governs the execution of a model in a domain-independent way.
Its methods are designed to be called by a GUI, an applet, a command-line
interface, or the top-level code of an application.  The manager can
execute the model in the calling thread or in a separate thread.
The latter is useful when the caller wishes to remain live during
the execution of the model.
<p>
There are three methods that can be used to start execution of a system
attached to the manager.  The execute() method is the most basic way to
execute a model.  The model will be executed <i>synchronously</i>,
meaning that the execute()
method will return when execution has completed.  Any exceptions that
occur will be thrown by the execute method to the calling thread, and will
not be reported to any execution listeners.  The run() method also
initiates synchronous execution of a model, but additionally catches all
exceptions and passes them to the notifyListenersOfException() method
<i>without throwing them to the calling thread</i>.
The startRun() method, unlike the previous two
techniques, begins <i>asynchronous</i> execution of a model.   This method
starts a new thread for execution of the model and then returns immediately.
Exceptions are reported using the notifyListenersOfException() method.
<p>
In addition, execution can be manually driven, one phase at a time, using the
methods initialize(), iterate() and wrapup().  This is most useful for
testing purposes.  For example, a type system check only needs to get the
resolved types, which are found during initialize, so the test can avoid
actually executing the system.  Also, when testing mutations, the model can
be examined after each toplevel iteration to ensure the proper behavior.
<p>
A manager provides services for cleanly handling changes to the
topology.  These include such changes as adding or removing an entity,
port, or relation, creating or destroying a link, and changing the value
or type of a parameter.  Collectively, such changes are called
<i>mutations</i>. Usually, mutations
cannot safely occur at arbitrary points in the execution of
a model.  Models can queue mutations with any object in the hierarchy or with
the manager using the requestChange() method.  An object in the hierarchy
simply delegates the request to its container, so the request propagates
up the hierarchy until it gets to the top level composite actor, which
delegates to the manager, which performs the change at the earliest
opportunity.  In this implementation of Manager, the changes are
executed between iterations.
<p>
A service is also provided whereby an object can be registered with the
composite actor as a change listener.  A change listener is informed when
mutations that are requested via requestChange() are executed successfully,
or when they fail with an exception.
<p>
Manager can optimize the performance of an execution by making
the workspace <i>write protected</i> during an iteration, if all
relevant directors permit this.  This removes some of the overhead
of obtaining read and write permission on the workspace.
By default, directors do not permit this, but
many directors explicitly relinquish write access to allow faster execution.
Such directors are declaring that they will not make changes to the
topology during execution.  Instead, any desired mutations are delegated
to the manager via the requestChange() method.
