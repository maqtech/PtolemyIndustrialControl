//// RemoteCompositeActor
/**
A RemoteCompositeActor is a CompositeActor that catches CORBA
exceptions. The purpose of a RemoteCompositeActor (RCA) is to
facilitate CORBA remote object invocation of actors and composite
actors during the execution of a Ptolemy II model.
<P>
The remote object invocation infrastructure incorporated into
Ptolemy II allows dynamic, remote access to actors (atomic or
composite). The purpose of an RCA is to isolate the Ptolemy II
manager from CORBA-related, network errors that can occur when
invoking remote objects. This is necessary to prevent the simulation
environment from shutting down if there is a CORBA exception. To
accomplish this task, RCA overrides several methods of CompositeActor
to catch org.omg.CORBA.SystemException.
<P>
CORBA, as with most remote object invocation systems (e.g., Java
RMI and Microsoft's DCOM), uses a client side stub and a server
side skeleton. Consider a topology in which a local actor, actor A,
is connected to a remote actor, actor B. In this case, actor A
would connect to a stub representing actor B. Calls made on B's
stub would invoke the appropriate response from B's skeleton running
on the remote server.
<P>
All stubs contained in a model must be contained either directly or
indirectly by an RCA. The RCA will catch any CORBA exceptions thrown
on behalf of the stub. Note that while stubs must be contained by an
RCA, it is not necessary that an RCA contain stubs. An RCA can be
chosen to be a top level composite actor or it can be located must
lower in a model's hierarchy. Since an RCA is opaque, it must contain
a local director and hence it must self contain a model of computation.
