/**
Thread class acting as a process for process oriented domains.
<P>
In process oriented domains, each actor acts as a separate process and
its execution is not centrally controlled by the director. Each process
runs concurrently with other processes and is responsible for calling
its execution methods.
<P>
This class provides the mechanism to implement the above.
An instance of this class can be created by passing an actor as an
argument to the constructor. This class runs as a separate thread on
being started and calls the execution methods on the actor, repeatedly.
In specific, it calls the prefire(), fire() and postfire() methods
of the actor. Before termination, this calls the wrapup() method of
the actor.
<P>
If an actor returns false in its postfire() methods, the
actor is never fired again and the thread or process would terminate
after calling wrapup() on the actor.
<P>
The initialize() method of the actor is not called from this class. It
should be called before starting this thread.
<P>
In process oriented domains, the director needs to keep a count of the
number of active processes in the system. This is used for detection of
deadlocks, termination, and possibly some other reasons. For this two
methods, _increaseActiveCount() and _decreaseActiveCount(), are defined
in the ProcessDirector. _increaseActiveCount() is called on the director
from the constructor of this class and the _decreaseActiveCount() method
is called at the end of the run() method, i.e. before the thread terminates.
<P>
