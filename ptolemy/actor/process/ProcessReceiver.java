/**
Interface for receivers in the process oriented domains.
It adds methods to the Receiver interface for setting flags that
indicate whether a pause, resume or termination of the simulation has
been requested.

In process oriented domains, simulations are normally ended on the
detection of a deadlock. During a deadlock, processes or the
corresponding threads are normally waiting on a call to some
methods (for reading or writing) on a receiver.
To terminate or end the simulation, these methods should
either return or throw an exception to inform the processes that they
should terminate themselves. For this a method requestFinish() is defined.
This method would set a local flag in the receivers and wake up all the
processes waiting on some call to the receiver. On waking up these
processes would see that the termination flag set and behave accordingly.
A sample implementation is <BR>
<Code>
public synchronized void requestFinish() {
    _terminate = true;
    notifyAll();
}
</code>
<p>

Similarly, in process oriented domains, a simulation can be paused,
safely, only when the processes try to communicate with some other
process by calling methods on the receiver. For this, a requestPause()
method is defined. This method will set a local flag in the receiver
which indicates that a pause has been requested. When a process next
calls any of the methods in the receiver to read or write a token,
it will be paused. To resume the simulation, the method will be called
with false as an argument. This method will then reset the local flag
and resume the paused processes.
A sample implementation is: <BR>
<code>
public synchronized void requestPause(boolean pause) {
    if (pause) {
        _pause = true;
    } else {
        _pause = false;
	notifyAll();
    }
}
</code>
