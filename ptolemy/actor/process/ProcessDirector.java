//// ProcessDirector
/**
Base class of directors for the process oriented domains. It provides
default implementations for methods that are common across such domains.
<p>
In the process oriented domains, the director controlling a model
needs to keep track of the state of the model. In particular it needs
to maintain an accurate count of the number of active processes under
its control, any processes that are blocked for whatever reason (trying
to read from an empty channel as in PN) and the number of processes that have
been paused. These counts, and perhaps other counts, are needed by the
director to control and respond when deadlock is detected (no processes
can make progress), or to respond to requests from higher in the hierarchy.
<p>
The methods that control how the director detects and responds to deadlocks
are _checkForDeadlock() and _handleDeadlock(). These methods should be
overridden in derived classes to get domain-specific behaviour. The
implementations given here are trivial and suffice only to illustrate
the approach that should be followed.
