//// MultiMap

/**
Defines a map that holds a collection of values against each key. 

A MultiMap is a Map with slightly different semantics. Putting a
value into the map will add the value to a Collection at that key.
Getting a value will return a Collection, holding all the values
put to that key.

For example: 

 MultiMap mhm = new MultiHashMap();
 mhm.put(key, "A");
 mhm.put(key, "B");
 mhm.put(key, "C");
 Collection coll = (Collection) mhm.get(key);coll will be a
 collection containing "A", "B", "C".
