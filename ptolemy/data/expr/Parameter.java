//// Parameter
/**
Parameter is almost identical to Variable, its base class, with the
only difference being the MoML representation.  The base class has none,
and therefore is not a persistent object.  This class has one.
A second reason for existence of this class is to serve as a
marker for variables that are to made
visible at the user interface level.  By convention, an instance
of NamedObj has a set of attributes, some of which are instances
of the class Parameter.  When a user interface presents these attributes
for editing, it presents only those that are instances of Parameter.
And the parameters, but not any variables, are exported to MoML when
the container object is exported.
