/**
This base class provides some common services for visual notations for
Ptolemy II models. It assumes that the semantic object of a particular
graph object is fixed, and provides facilities for making changes to the
model via a change request. It supports visible attributes.
<p>
This class uses a change listener to detect changes to the Ptolemy model
that do not originate from this class.  These changes are propagated
as structure changed graph events to all graphListeners registered with this
model.  This mechanism allows a graph visualization of a ptolemy model to
remain synchronized with the state of a mutating model.
