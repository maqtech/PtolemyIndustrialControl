//// AttributeController
/**
This class provides interaction with nodes that represent Ptolemy II
attributes.  It provides a double click binding and context menu
entry to edit the parameters of the node ("Configure") and a
command to get documentation.
It can have one of two access levels, FULL or PARTIAL.
If the access level is FULL, the the context menu also
contains a command to rename the node.
