/**
An implementation of a selection renderer that is used for animation.
It highlights specified figures by wrapping them in an instance of
a FigureDecorator. The figure decorator is obtained by
cloning a prototype decorator, accessible through the
get/setFigureDecorator() methods. The default prototype
is an instance of BasicHighlighter that highlights in red.
<p>
This class is fashioned after BasicSelectionRenderer, but differs
in that it ensures that selection and deselection occurs in the event
thread. Also, it highlights objects in red rather than yellow.
