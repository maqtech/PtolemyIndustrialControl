<DT> <A NAME="virgil"><B>1.3 Isn't the guy's name 'Virgil'?</B></A>

translations seems to be split about an accepted spelling.  If you are
interested in the author, try <a href="http://www.virgil.org" target="_top">www.virgil.org</a> for more information about him.  The name was chosen as a pseudo-acronym for
"Visual Editing Graphical Interactive Language".

<DT> <A NAME="vergil copyright"><B>1.4 What is the copyright?</B></A>
<DD> Vergil is released under the fairly liberal UC Berkeley copyright,
see <a href="../../../copyright.txt">copyright.txt</a>.
Most files have the copyright at the top.

 <p>Vergil is free for academic and commercial use.  You an incorporate it
into products, but you need to follow the instructions in the
copyright notice.

 <p>This copyright is based on the Tcl copyright that was used when
Prof. Ousterhout was developing Tcl here at UC Berkeley.  This
copyright was also used in Ptolemy Classic, which has been used in
commercial products.

<DT> <A NAME="contact"><B>1.5 How do I contact the authors?</B></A>
<DD> The primary author of Vergil is Stephen Neuendorffer.
You can contact the author at
<A HREF="mailto:neuendor@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>neuendor@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>

<DT> <A NAME="mailing list"><B>1.6 Is there a mailing list?</B></A>
<DD> We have an internal mailing list <code>ptguidevel</code> for people 
actively developing and contributing to vergil.  There is currently no
external mailing list.
<!-- 
FIXME!
<DD> We maintain the <CODE>vergil-announce</CODE> alias for announcing
new vergil releases.  This alias is for Vergil announcements only.  Thus,
you cannot post to this group.  To subscribe to this group,
send email to <A HREF="mailto:vergil-announce-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>vergil-announce-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>
with the word <CODE>subscribe</CODE> in the body, not the header.

upgrade your browser.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm">Installing Vergil</a> page 
for more information
 <P>You can also run Vergil as an applet in your local browser.  
 <p>Vergil uses <a href="http://www.gigascale.org/diva">Diva</a>, and a jar file of the Diva class files is included in the installation.

Your mail should include:
<OL>
<LI> What version of Vergil you are running.
<LI> What platform you are running under (Solaris, Windows etc.)
<LI> Exactly how to reproduce the bug.
