BUGS:
Fix layering of nodes and edges
The TreePane should have the first level expanded by default.
Layout breaks when toolbar gets dragged to the bottom.
Node deletion is broken when an edge is connected.
Do something reasonable when a model is loaded that has no graphical
information.

TODO:
Snap to Grid.
Director specification.
Title box on each graph.
Text Annotation.
Better layout for Palette.
Port to port direct connections.  (How should this work?)
Icon drawing app.
Better parameter configuration.
Cut and Paste.
