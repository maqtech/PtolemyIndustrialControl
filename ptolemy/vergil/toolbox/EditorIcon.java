//// EditorIcon
/**
An icon represnts the visual representation of a schematic entity.
Every icon has a name, along with the data necessary for creating 
a visual representation.
EditorIcons are capable of creating a visual representation representing
the icon as either a Swing icon (e.g. an instance of javax.swing.Icon), 
or as a Diva figure (e.g. an instanceof of diva.canvas.Figure).
In general, one or the other will form the basis of the visual representation, 
and the other will be created from the first, using either a SwingWrapper
or a FigureIcon.  In other words, this class is a factory for visual
representations.
<p> In this base class, the visual representation as a Diva
figure is created by adding a label representing the name of the entity that
contains this icon to a background figure which is created by the 
createBackgroundFigure method.  The visual representation as a Swing icon
is created from the background figure using a FigureIcon.
Thus, most subclasses that which to modify the visual representation can 
simply override the createBackgroundFigure method.
<p> Subclasses that wish to create the figure or the icon in a different way
entirely (for example, starting with a Swing icon and creating the figure using
a SwingWrapper) should override both the createBackgroundFigure and 
createIcon methods.
<p>
This visual representation created by this base class is just a simple white
 box.  For a more interesting icon, see the XMLIcon class.
