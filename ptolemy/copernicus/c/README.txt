This directory contains a C back-end for Ptolemy II code generation, as well as
standalone functionality for converting Java class files into C source files
that implement the classes. For two demos of the Java-to-C conversion
functionality, run the following commands:

	cd ptolemy/copernicus/c/test
	make Simple

    cd ptolemy/copernicus/c/test/FIR
    make fir
