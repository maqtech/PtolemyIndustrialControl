An inequality over a CPO.
Each inequality consists of two <code>InequalityTerms</code>, the lesser
term and the greater term. The relation between them is <i>less than or
equal to</i>.  In addition, an inequality keeps a list of variables in it.
The variables are <code>Inequalityterms</code> that consist of a single
variable.
