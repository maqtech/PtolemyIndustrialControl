//// Analysis
/** A base class for analyses on graphs. To faciliate demand-driven
and incremental recomputation (e.g., see [1]) of analyses, analysis results 
are cached
internally (see {@link #_cachedResult()}), and are recomputed only
when the graph has changed since the last request (via {@link #result()})
for the analysis result. The internally-cached result (<em>cached result</em>)
of an analysis is directly accessible only by derived classes; however,
its status can be queried with the {@link #obsolete()} method to determine
if a subsequent invocation of {@link #result()} will trigger recomputation
of the analysis.
