//// FileAttribute
/**
This is an attribute that specifies a file or URL.  The value of this
attribute, accessed by getExpression(), is a string that names a file
or URL. If the model containing this attribute has been saved to a
MoML file, then the file name can be given relative to the directory
containing that MoML file.  If the model has not been saved to a file,
then the classpath is used for identifying relative file names.
<p>
Files can be given relative to a <i>base</i>, where the base is
the URI of the first container above this one that has a URIAttribute.
Normally, this URI specifies the file or URL containing the model
definition. Thus, files that are refered to here can be kept in the
same directory as the model, or in a related directory, and can
moved together with the model.
<p>
The following special file names are understood:
<ul>
<li> System.in: Standard input.
<li> System.out: Standard output.
</ul>
Note, however, that these file names cannot be converted to URLs
using the asURL() method.
<p>
A file name can also contain the string "$PTII", which refers to
the home directory of the Ptolemy II installation, or the string
"$CWD", which refers the current working directory, or "$HOME",
which refers to the user's home directory.  These values are
obtained from the Java properties <i>ptolemy.ptII.dir</i>,
<i>user.dir</i>, and <i>user.home</i>, respectively.  These
properties are normally set when a Ptolemy II application starts.
<p>
If a file name begins with the string "$CLASSPATH", followed by either
"/" or "\", then when the file
is opened for reading, the openForReading() method
will search for the file relative to the classpath (using the
getResource() method of the current class loader).  This will only
work for a file that exists, and thus the openForWriting() method
will not understand the "$CLASSPATH" string; this makes sense
since the classpath typically has several directories, and it
would not be obvious where to create the file.  The asURL()
method also recognizes the "$CLASSPATH" string, but not the asFile()
method (which is typically used when accessing a file for writing).
