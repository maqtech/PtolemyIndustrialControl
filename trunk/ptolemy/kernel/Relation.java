/**
   A Relation links ports, and therefore the entities that contain them.
   To link a port to a relation, use the link() method
   in the Port class.  To remove a link, use the unlink() method in the
   Port class.
   <p>
   Derived classes may wish to disallow links under certain circumstances,
   for example if the proposed port is not an instance of an appropriate
   subclass of Port, or if the relation cannot support any more links.
   Such derived classes should override the protected method _checkPort()
   to throw an exception.
