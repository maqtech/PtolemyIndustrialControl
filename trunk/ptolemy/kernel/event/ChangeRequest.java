//// ChangeRequest
/** 
Abstract base class for change requests.  A change request is any
modification to a model that might be performed during execution of the
model, but where there might only be certain phases of execution during
which it is safe to make the modification.  Such changes are called
<i>mutations</i>.
<p>
A typical use of this class is to define an anonymous inner class that
implements the execute() method to bring about the desired change.
The instance of that anonymous inner class is then queued with the
director or manager using the requestChange() method.
<p>
Alternatively, a set of concrete derived classes are provided that
implement a few of the more common sorts of mutations. These derived
classes can be instantiated and queued with the director or manager.
To ensure that a group of such changes is executed together,
use ChangeList to collect them, and queue the instance of
ChangeList with the director or manager.
