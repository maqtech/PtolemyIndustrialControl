//// NamedObj
/**
This is a base class for objects with a name. A simple name is an arbitrary
string. If no simple name is provided, the name is taken to be an
empty string (not a null reference). The class also has a full name,
which is a concatenation of the container's full name and the simple
name, separating by a period. Obviously, if the simple name contains
a period then there may be some confusion resolving the full name,
so periods are discouraged (but not disallowed). If there is no
container, then the full name is a concatenation of the workspace
name with the simple name. The
full name is used for error reporting throughout the package, which
is why it is supported at this low level of the class hierarchy.
<p>
Instances of this class are associated with a workspace, specified
as a constructor argument.  The workspace is immutable.  It cannot
be changed during the lifetime of the object.  It is used for
synchronization of methods that depend on or modify the state of
objects within it.  It is also used for tracking the version of any
topology within the workspace.
Any method in this class or derived classes that changes visible
state of any object within the workspace should call the
incrVersion() method of the workspace.  If no workspace is
specified, then the default workspace is used.
Note that the workspace should not be confused with the container.
The workspace never serves as a container.
<p>
In this base class, the container is null by default, and no method is
provided to change it. Derived classes that support hierarchy provide one
or more methods that set the container.
<p>
By convention, if the container of
a NamedObj is set, then it should be removed from the workspace directory,
if it is present.  The workspace directory is expected
to list only top-level objects in a hierarchy.
The NamedObj can still use the workspace for synchronization.
Any object contained by another uses the workspace of its container
as its own workspace by default.
<p>
Instances of Attribute can be attached by calling their setContainer()
method and passing this object as an argument. These instances will then
be reported by the getAttribute() and getAttributes() methods.
Classes derived from NamedObj may constrain attributes to be a subclass
of Attribute.  To do that, they should override the protected
_addAttribute() method to throw an exception if the
object provided is not of the right class.
<p>
Derived classes should override the _description() method to append
new fields if there is new information that should be included in the
description.
