//// UndoInfoAttribute
/**
An attribute that holds the undo/redo information about a models change
history. This attribute is not persistent. This makes sense because a user
commonly expects a models undo/redo information to disappear once the
application that is being worked on is closed. It is also a singleton,
meaning that it will replace any previous attribute that has the same name
and is an instance of the base class, SingletonAttribute.

<p>Two stacks of information are maintained - one for undo information and
one for redo information. The information in the redo stack is placed there
whenever an undo is carried out, and can be used to reverse the effect
of the undo.

<p>NOTE: the information in the redo stack is emptied when a new undo entry is
pushed onto the undo stack that was not the result of a redo being
requested. This situation arises when a user requests a series of undo
and redo operations, and then performs some normal undoable action. At this
point the information in the redo stack is not relevant to the state of
the model and so must be cleared.
