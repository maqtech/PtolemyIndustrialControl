/**
An entry into the list of actions that can be un-done. If undo/redo
is enabled, an instance of a class derived from this class is created
each time an operation is carried out on a MoML model following its
initial creation.
<p>
This class contains that info which will be common so all undo entries,
and defines methods that each such entry should provide e.g. redo()

FIXME: this class may do well as an interface...
