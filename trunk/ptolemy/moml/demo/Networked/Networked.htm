This model contains a component that is defined on the Ptolemy project
website.  When you open the model, you will be alerted to the fact
that it requires loading a model definition from a remote source.
If you agree to proceed, then you will have a model with a remotely
defined component.  The component itself is at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml">
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml</a>.
You can open that definition by clicking on the hyperlink, or by
using the "Open URL" command in the File menu.
<P>
The <a href="NetworkedVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
