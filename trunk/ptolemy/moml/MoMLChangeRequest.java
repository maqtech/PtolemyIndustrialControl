//// MoMLChangeRequest
/**
A mutation request specified in MoML.  This class provides the preferred
mechanism for implementing mutations on a model while it is executing.
To use it, create an instance of this class, specifying MoML code as
an argument to the constructor.  Then queue the instance of this class
with a composite entity by calling its requestChange() method.
<p>
There is one significant subtlety with using this class.
If you create a MoMLChangeRequest with a specified context,
then the change will be executed in that context.  Moreover, if
that context has other objects deferring their MoML definitions to
it, then the change will be replicated in those other objects.
This is the principal mechanism in MoML for an object to serve
as a class definition, and others to serve as instances.  A change
to the class propagates to the instances.  However, it means that
when you make a change request, you have to be sure to pick the
right context.  The getDeferredToParent() method returns the first
parent in the containment hierarchy of its argument that has other
objects deferring their MoML definitions to it.  That is the correct
context to use for a change request.
<p>
The parser used to implement the change will be the parser contained
by a ParserAttribute of the top-level element of the context.  If no
context is given, or there is no ParserAttribute in its top level,
then a new parser is created, and a new ParserAttribute is placed
in the top level.
<p>
NOTE: A significant subtlety remains.  If the parent
returned by getDeferredToParent() itself has a parent that
is deferred to, then changes will <i>not</i> propagate to the
objects that defer to it.  That is, if a MoML class contains
a MoML class, and a change is made to the inner class, then
instances of the outer class are unaffected.
Perhaps MoML should not permit inner classes.
