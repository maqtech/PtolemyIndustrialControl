//// LocatableNodeController
/**
This node controller provides interaction techniques for nodes that are
associated with locatable objects.   This is common when the node has some
concept of its graphical location, but does not know about the figure that it
is associated with.  This class provides the connection between the 
figure's notion of location and the node's concept of location.
<p>
When nodes are drawn, they are automatically placed at the 
coordinate given by the Locatable interface, if that interface is
implemented by the object attached to the node.  A LocatableNodeDragInteractor
is used to update the location of the node as the figure moves.
