BUGS:
Fix layering of nodes and edges
The TreePane should have the first level expanded by default.
Layout breaks when toolbar gets dragged to the bottom.
Node deletion is broken when an edge is connected.
plot: fill doesn't work when graph shrinks
When a graph with no graphical information is loaded, then layout should be triggered.
If an executed model refs other files, then those files should be relative to the model, not to the cwd of the editor.
Messages at bottom of screen
Better exception reporting
