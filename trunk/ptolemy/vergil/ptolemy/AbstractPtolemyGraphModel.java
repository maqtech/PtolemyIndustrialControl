//// AbstractPtolemyGraphModel
/**
This class defines some useful things that help to create new visual notations
for ptolemy models.  It handles the things that almost all such models need
to handle.  It assumes that all the objects in the graph are ptolemy named
objects.  It also assumes that the semantic object of a particular
graph object is fixed.  Lastly, it makes sure that all the modifications to
the ptolemy model that use this interface occur within a change request.
<p>
This model uses a ptolemy change listener to detect changes to the model that
do not originate from this model.  These changes are propagated
as structure changed graph events to all graphListeners registered with this
model.  This mechanism allows a graph visualization of a ptolemy model to
remain synchronized with the state of a mutating model.
