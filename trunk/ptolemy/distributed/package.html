The ptolemy.distributed package domain is an extended 
version of the existing Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) domain
that performs the simulation in a distributed manner.

 <p>The ptolemy.distributed package was developed by
Daniel Lazaro Cuadrado (Aalborg University).

 <p>The ptolemy.distributed package uses Jini, which is "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jini">a network architecture for
the construction of distributed systems in the form of modular
co-operating services</a>".  We include Jini jar files
in <CODE>$PTII/ptolemy/distributed/jini/jar/</CODE>.
When <CODE>./configure</CODE> in the <CODE>$PTII</CODE>
directory, the script searches for the Jini jar files
and sets corresponding variables in <CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk</CODE>
