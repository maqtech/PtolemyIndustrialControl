//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Decl
/**
A Decl encapsulates information about a declaration of some entity.
There is a unique Decl for each Decl in the compilation.
<p>
The class Decl and its subclasses declare attributes, most of which make
sense only for certain types of Decl.  Attempts to access nonsensical
attributes will cause runtime errors.
<p>
By convention, a Decl member named "getFoo" will return the "foo"
attribute when called with no parameters, and a member "setFoo" will
set the "foo" attribute when called with one parameter.
Also, if member "foo" is not valid for all Decls, there is a member
"hasFoo()" that returns true or false depending on whether object
on which it is called has a class for which "foo" may be called.
<p>
Portions of this code were derived from sources developed under the
auspices of the Titanium project, under funding from the DARPA, DoE,
and Army Research Office.
