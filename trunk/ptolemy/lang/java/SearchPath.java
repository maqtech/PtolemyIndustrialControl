/** A vector containing paths to search for when resolving an import or
package.

This class is used by the code generation system to find class
definitions.  The codegen system uses reflection to find definitions
of some classes and parses .java files for other classes.  This
class provides functionality to find classes in both categories.
This class can be thought of as an augmentation to the CLASSPATH
facility.  Note that we can't use the ClassLoader because
not all of the .java files we are interested in will have been compiled.

This class also defines Sets of classes and packages to help find
System classes and packages as well as Ptolemy core classes and
packages.

<p>There are three ways that classes are read in.
<ol>
<li> The class is a System class (such as java.lang.Object),
and it is read in using reflection.
<li> The class is a Ptolemy core class (such as ptolemy.kernel.util.NamedObj)
and it is read in using reflection.
<li> The class is read in as a file and parsed.
</ol>



<p>
Portions of this code were derived from sources developed under the
auspices of the Titanium project, under funding from the DARPA, DoE,
and Army Research Office.

<p>FIXME: This should probably not extend Vector, instead it should
extend ArrayList, which is not synchronized, see:
http://www.javasoft.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/implementations/general.html
