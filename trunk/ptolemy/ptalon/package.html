Ptalon utilities.

<p>Ptalon is a composition language developed by the Ptolemy group. As a
beta target, we are simply generating Ptolemy-compliant Java
code. Ptalon says nothing about computation, only the structure of
hierarchical models that communicate through ports. This will make it
easy to build Ptalon compilers for other targets, such as embedded C
code or VHDL.
