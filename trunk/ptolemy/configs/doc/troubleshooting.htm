items to include in this troubleshooting guide.
<ul>
<li><b>The user interface appears to be frozen, but windows are redrawn</b>.
       A modal dialog may be open.  Unfortunately, these dialogs do not
       appear in the task bar on windows systems, so the only way to
       find them is to put windows in the background until they appear.
       You can do this by repeatedly hitting Alt-Escape.</li>
<li><b>My model hangs, failing to make progress</b>. In the DE domain,
       if an actor has input tokens that it fails to consume when it is
       fired, then it the director will continue to fire it repeatedly
       until those tokens are consumed.  Actors in the DE domain must
       consume pending input tokens.</li>
</ul>
