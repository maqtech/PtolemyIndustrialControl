The Ptolemy Project
</h1>
<p>
The Ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of
concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. The focus is on assembly of
concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is
the use of well-defined <i>models of computation</i> that govern the
interaction between components. A major problem area being addressed is
the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation.
A software system called Ptolemy II is being constructed in Java.
<p>
Ptolemy II is a software framework developed as part of the Ptolemy project.
It is a Java-based component assembly framework with a graphical
user interface called Vergil.
