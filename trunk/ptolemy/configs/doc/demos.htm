The following links open Ptolemy models in Vergil.
To run the models, select "Run Window" from the "View" menu.
The diagrams are fully editable, so feel free to explore.

<li><a href="demo/modulation.xml">Modulation of a sine wave in SDF</a>
<br> This example illustrates hierarchical models, the Expression actor, live
parameter editing, the FFT actor, and a scope-style display.
The Sinewave actors with the blue outline are hierarchical.
Right click on the mouse and select "look inside" to see their refinement.
This model is build using the <i>synchronous dataflow</i> (SDF) domain,
which statically schedules the firing of the actors.
You can also use a <i>process networks</i> (PN) director,
in which case each actor is executed in a separate Java thread.
The PN domain is more flexible than SDF, but this flexibility comes
with a noticable performance penalty.  To try this model in the PN
domain, simply drag in a PN director from the director library.

<li>Hybrid system model.
<br> This example illustrates the use of the finite-state-machine (FSM)
domain together with another domain to get a <i>modal model</i>.
A special case of modal models are <i>hybrid systems</i>, where FSM
is combined with CT.</br></li>
