<h1>Help for the Viptos 5.1-alpha Sensor Networks Development Platform</h1>
<p>
Running a TinyOS model from within Viptos does not work under Windows.
 <p>The reason is that we use JNI to load the TinyOS code back in
to the running Ptolemy process.  Unfortunately, the TinyOS code
uses pthreads, which is incompatible when Windows native threads.
 <br>We are working on a solution.

 <p>For information about using Viptos, see the 
<a href="docs.htm">Viptos documentation</a>.
