Example demonstrates also Trace features:
  I/O displayed in Logic Analyzer

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      runs in µVision Simulator
  LM3S8962 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)
