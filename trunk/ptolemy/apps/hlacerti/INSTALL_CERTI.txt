Installation and deployment of CERTI

Requirements: we assume that you have a
- recent C++ compiler 
- the CMake tool

###################################
1) Installation process (summary):

	1.	Get the last CERTI cvs source using the command: 
	
	      cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/sources/certi co certi
	
	2.	Go to the CERTI cvs folder downloaded
	3.	Create the folder 'build_certi' and go to this folder
	4.	Run 'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path_for_scripts_and_binaries> ../'. All  files required to build CERTI are stored in the 'build_certi' folder.
	5.	Run 'make'
	6.	Run 'make install'

Note: In your current terminal, you'll see  information about the (correct) build of CERTI and where are stored the different environment scripts used to set the CERTI environment.

#############
2) Deployment

For the deployment of an HLA Federation in C++, you need to launch one terminal for running the 'rtig' binary, and one terminal per federate if you have displayed information. To excute the 'rtig' or a federate do this procedure :

	1.	Open a new terminal
	2.	Source the CERTI environment script. This script is stored in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set during the installation process (see previous subsection).
	3.	'source <path_for_scripts_and_binaries>/share/scripts/myCERTI.sh'
	4.	Run 'rtig' or the federate required, for example './<fed-binary>'

3) Debug information

Environment variables used to display traces (e.g. messages) from CERTI :

- 'export RTIG_MSG=D' in RTIG (for messages exchanged between RTIA <--> RTIG)

- 'export RTIA_MSG=D' in a Federate's terminal (for messages exchanges between Federate <--> RTIA)
