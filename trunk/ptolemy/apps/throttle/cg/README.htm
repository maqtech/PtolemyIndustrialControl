Attached is the model I started modifying.  It currently
just outputs a sinewave, which is probably right...
Without hooking it up to some sort of model of dynamics,
we can't expect much more.  But code generating this would
certainly be a good starting point, and make a decent demo.

Note:  Tunc's model is likely to be better, so if you have already
made some sense of his, go with that...  But if you haven't started
with his, this one will probably be more straightforward.

 Complete throttle body model from Tunc Simsek

here is the file without modifications.  
to make it run using a single sdf controller
you would need to do the following:

 <p>replace "tunc.controller.sampled controller.real-time controller"
with the refinement of the "driver" mode of
 "tunc.controller.sampled controller.real-time controller.servo 
controller.modal controller"

 <p>And that should give you a purely SDF pedal tracking controller.

 <p>  Best,

 <p>ps. the version of ptolemy i'm using is the one i checked out
  and compiled on the 9th(or 10th) of January.
