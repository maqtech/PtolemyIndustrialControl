/** A simple application that demonstrates the use of SoundCapture
   and SoundPlayback. This application performs real-time
   capture, processing, and playback of audio data.
   Sound samples are captured from the computer's audio
   input port. The processing consists of a simple
   soft-clipping funtion (the arc tangent is used). The
   soft-clipped audio data is then played out the speaker.
