/**
  This class supports live capture and playback of audio 
  samples. For audio capture, audio samples are captured 
  from the audio input port of the computer. The audio input 
  port is typically associated with the line-in port, 
  microphone-in port, or cdrom audio-in port. It is not 
  possible to select the desired input port from Java. The 
  desired input port may be selected from the operating 
  system. For audio playback, audio samples are written to 
  the audio output port. The audio output port is typically 
  associated with the headphones jack or the internal 
  speaker of the computer. The desired output port may be 
  selected from the operating system.
  <p>
  <b>Format of audio samples</be>
  <p>
  In this class, audio samples are double-valued and have a 
  valid range of [-1.0, 1.0]. Thus when this class is used 
  for audio capture, the returned samples will all range in 
  value from -1.0 to 1.0. When this class is used for audio 
  playback, the valid range of input samples is from -1.0 to 
  1.0. Any samples that are outside of this range will be 
  hard-clipped to fall within this range.
  <p>
  <b>Supported audio formats</b>
  <p>
  This class supports the subset of the hardware supported 
  audio formats that are also supported under Java. Provided 
  that the computer has a sound card that was manufactured 
  after 1998, the following formats are likely to be supported.
  <ul>
  <li><i>channels</i>: Mono (channels = 1) and stereo 
  (channels = 1) audio is supported. Note that some newer sound 
  cards support more than two channels, such as 4 input, 4 output 
  channels or better. Java does not support more than two 
  channels, however. The default value assumed by this class is
  mono (1 channel). The number of channels may be set by the 
  setChannels() method and read by the getChannels method().
  <li><i>sample rates</i>: 8000, 11025, 22050, 44100, and 
  48000 Hz are supported. Note that some newer sound cards 
  support 96000 Hz sample rates, but this is not supported under 
  Java. The default sample rate used by this class is 8000 Hz. 
  The sample rate may be set by the setSampleRate() method and 
  read by the getSampleRate() method.
  <li><i>bit resolution</i>: 8 bit and 16 bit audio is supported. 
  Note that some newer sound cards support 20 bit, 24 bit, and 32 
  bit audio, but this is not supported under Java. The default 
  bit resolution used by this class is 16 bit audio. The bit 
  resolution may be set by the setBitsPerSample() method and 
  read by the getBitsPerSample() method.
  </ul>
  <p>
  <b>Input/output latency</b>
  <p>
  When capturing audio samples, there will be some delay (latency) 
  from the time the sound arrives at the input port to the time 
  that the corresponding audio samples are available from this 
  class. Likewise, there will be some delay from the time sample 
  are written until the corresponding audio signal reaches the 
  output port (e.g., the speaker). This is because an internal 
  buffer is used to temporarily store audio samples when they are 
  captured or played. The size of this internal buffer affects 
  the latency in that a lower bound on the capture (playback) 
  latency is given by (<i>bufferSize</i> / <i>sampleRate</i>) 
  seconds. Here, <i>bufferSize</i> parameter is the size of the 
  buffer in samples per channel. This class provides a method, 
  setBufferSize(), to simultaneously set the size of internal 
  capture buffer and the internal playback buffer. The method 
  getBufferSize() may be used to read the buffer size. The default 
  size of the internal buffer is 4096.
  <p>
  <b>Constraints</b>
  <p>
  This class requires that the sample rate, number of channels, 
  bit resolution, and internal buffer size be the same for both 
  capture and playback. The motivation for this constraint is to 
  simplify usage. Most audio hardware requires this anyway.
  <p>
  <b>Usage: audio capture</b>
  <p>
  First, call the appropriate methods to set the desired audio 
  format parameters such as sample rate, channels, bit resolution 
  if values other than the defaults are desired. The 
  setTransferSize() method should also be invoked to set the size 
  of the array (in samples per channel) that is returned when 
  audio samples are captured. The default value is 128 samples 
  per channel. Then invoke the startCapture(consumer) method to 
  start the audio capture process. This class will be ready to 
  capture audio immediately after startCapture() returns. Note 
  that startCapture() takes an Object parameter, <i>consumer</i>. 
  In addition to starting the audio capture process, startCapture() 
  also grants an object permission to capture audio.
  <p>
  After calling startCapture(consumer), the consumer object can 
  capture audio from the input port by calling getSamples(consumer). 
  The getSamples() method returns an array of samples from the input 
  port. The getSamples() blocks until the requested number of 
  samples (which is set by the setTransferSize method) are available. 
  Thus, it is not possible to call this method too frequently. 
  Note that if getSamples() is not called frequently enough, 
  the internal buffer will overflow and some audio data will 
  be lost, which is generally undersirable. After the conumser 
  object no longer wishes to capture audio, it should free up the 
  audio system resources by calling the stopCapture(consumer) 
  method. It should be noted that only one object may capture 
  audio simultaneously from the audio input port. A future 
  version of this class may support multiple objects capturing 
  from the input port simultaneously.
  <p>
  <b>Usage: audio Playback</b>
  <p>  
  First, call the appropriate methods to set the desired audio 
  format parameters such as sample rate, channels, bit 
  resolution if values other than the defaults are desired. 
  The setTransferSize() method should also be invoked to set the 
  size of the array (in samples per channel) that is supplied 
  when audio samples are played. The default value is 128 samples 
  per channel. Then invoke the startPlayback(producer) method 
  to start the audio playback process. This class will be ready 
  to playback audio immediately after startPlayback() returns. 
  Note that startPlayback() takes an Object parameter, 
  <i>producer</i>. In addition to starting the audio playback 
  process, startCapture() also grants an object permission to 
  playback audio.
  <p>
  After calling startPlayback(producer), the producer object can 
  playback audio to the output port by calling putSamples(producer). 
  The putSamples() method takes an array of samples and sends the 
  audio data to the output port. The putSamples() method blocks 
  until the requested number of samples (which is set by the 
  setTransferSize method) have been written to the output port. 
  Thus, it is not possible to call this method too frequently. 
  Note that if putSamples() is not called frequently enough, 
  the internal buffer will underflow, causing audible artifacts 
  in the output signal. After the producer object no longer wishes 
  to playback audio, it should free up the audio system resources 
  by calling the stopPlayback(producer) method. It should be noted 
  that only one object may playback audio simultaneously to the 
  audio output port. A future version of this class may support 
  multiple objects playing to the output port simultaneously.
