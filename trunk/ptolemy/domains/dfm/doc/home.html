<h1>Design Flow Management</h1>
<p>
Design Flow Management (DFM) domain in Ptolemy II is an environment for
engineers to specify and execute a design flow of a system in block
diagram syntax.  The design flow can contain loops and iterations.  
Because DFM is based on a multi-thread domain, parallel flow execution
can be achieved with multiprocessors, or distributed object technology.
User can efficiently explore the design space by testing or fine tuning
various parameters.  The management function in DFM will not invoke a tool
if its input or its parameter has not been changed.
<p>
External tools can be plugged into DFM with specifically designed tool 
interface.  Tool actor in DFM go through the tool interface to communicate
with the tool.  The tool interface can be extended to support CORBA distributed
tool object.
<P>
DFM semantics is based on timed Process Network (PN).  Tags on the data tokens
are used to manage the flow.  The tags are "New_Data", "Previous_Result_Valid",
"No_Op", and "Annotate".
