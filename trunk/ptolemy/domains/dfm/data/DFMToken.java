/** 
  This is the base token class to be used within DFM domain.  This kind
  of toke is different from those in the data package by adding a tag in
  it fields.  The tag is a string that will be processed by DFM actor.
  These are the tag value: <p>
   "New" - this value on this token is newly produced. <p>
   "Previous Result Valid" - previous result sent from the same channel is 
    still valid. <p>
   "Noop" - No need to do anything. <p>
   "Annotate" - This token give some information to user that annotate to the
     design.  No design will be produced from this type of token.  <p>
  <p>
  The tag is set in the constructor or <code> setTag() </code>.  
  The tag can get with getTag() method.
  <p>
