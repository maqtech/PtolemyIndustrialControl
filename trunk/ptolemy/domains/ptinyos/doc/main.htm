<h1>Ptolemy II Network Embedded Systems C (PtinyOS) Domain</h1> 

<p>The Ptolemy II Network Embedded Systems C (PtinyOS) domain supports the
construction of programs in nesC, from
<a href="http://nescc.sourceforge.net#in_browser" target="_top">http://nescc.sourceforge.net</a>.
That web page describes nesC as 
<blockquote>
&quot;an extension to the C programming
language designed to embody the structuring concepts and execution
model of TinyOS. TinyOS is an event-driven operating system designed
for sensor network nodes that have very limited resources (e.g., 8K
bytes of program memory, 512 bytes of RAM).&quot;
</blockquote>
TinyOS, described at
<a href="http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos/" target="_top">http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos/</a>,
is used, for example, on the Berkeley MICA &quot;motes,&quot; which
are small wireless sensor nodes.</p>

<p>The domain leverages existing nesC libraries, using a tool called
nc2momllib to create the Ptolemy II libraries of components that are
used to assemble models. Models are converted into nesC code by the
PtinyOSDirector. TinyOS provides a rich library of nesC components. If
you install TinyOS in $PTII/vendors/ptinyos (FIXME:
<code>/tinyos-1.x</code>?), then the Ptolemy II configure script will
find it and automatically make the TinyOS libraries available.</p>

<p>FIXME: Explain how to install TinyOS and use the included nesC
compiler to compile generated code. Provide a built-in small library
so that this can be used right away.</p>

<p>In order to leverage another existing library of nesC components,
you have to run nc2momllib on that library.</p> 

<p>FIXME: Instructions here for just obtaining the binary, which since
it's GPL'd, presumably has to include source code, but doesn't require
building, and hence doesn't require the following nightmare.</p>

<p>Below are the detailed instructions for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Running simple code generation demos using built-in demo nesC libraries.</li>
      <li>Installing TinyOS and making its nesC libraries visible in Ptolemy II.</li>
      <li><a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/other/nc2momllib/index.htm">Installing nc2momllib source code and compiling that source code.</a></li>
    </ul>
