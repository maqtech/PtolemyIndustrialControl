<h1>Ordered Dataflow</h1>
<P>
The Ordered Dataflow (OD) domain incorporates
a distributed notion of time into a dataflow style communication semantic.
Much of the functionality of the OD domain is consistent with the 
<A HREF="../../pn/doc/home.html"> Process Networks domain </A>. 
In particular, this model of computation's mechanism for dealing with 
blocking due to empty or full queues is functionally identical to that of
the PN domain.
<P>
The OD domain's use of time serves as the point of divergence in the 
respective designs of OD and PN. Time progress is communicated between
actors by passing Tokens that have time stamps associated with them.
In a network of OD actors each actor has a local notion of time. To 
facilitate this local notion of time, ODActors adhere to the following 
constraints:
<UL>
    <LI> Successive tokens emitted from any ODActor output port must 
	 have a time stamp that is greater <BR> than or equal to that 
	 of previous tokens.
    <LI> An ODActor can consume a token on an input port (P1) only if the 
	 the other input ports of that <BR> actor have pending tokens with 
	 time stamps greater than or equal to that of P1.
    <LI> If an ODActor has two or more input ports with pending time stamps 
	 that are identical, then a local <BR> input port prioritization rule 
	 must be invoked to determine the ordering of these "simultaneous" 
	 tokens.
</UL>
The above rules facilitate a local notion of time and are consistent with
the "conservative" blocking mechanism of Chandy and Misra's distributed 
discrete event system.
</A>.
<P>
We are approaching the OD model of computation as the intersection between
dataflow and discrete event semantics. This allows us to study OD 
semantics from two different perspectives. In particular, we can benefit
from denotational semantics that are based on metric spaces (the Banach
oriented DE approach) or posets (the Tarskian dataflow approach). Matthews
offers a partial metric topology which incorporates both of these 
mathematical tools. We expect to apply the OD domain towards modelling 
distributed systems and in the use of distributed debuggers.
