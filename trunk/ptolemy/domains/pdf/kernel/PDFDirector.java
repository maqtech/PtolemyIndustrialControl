/**
   <h1>PDF overview</h1>
   The Synchronous Dataflow(PDF) domain supports the efficient
   execution of Dataflow graphs that
   lack control structures.   Dataflow graphs that contain control structures
   should be executed using the Process Networks(PN) domain instead.
   PDF allows efficient execution, with very little overhead at runtime.  It
   requires that the rates on the ports of all actors be known before hand.
   PDF also requires that the rates on the ports not change during
   execution.  In addition, in some cases (namely systems with feedback) delays,
   which are represented by initial tokens on relations must be explicitly
   noted.  PDF uses this rate and delay information to determine
   the execution sequence of the actors before execution begins.
   <h2>Schedule Properties</h2>
   <ul>
   <li>The number of tokens accumulated on every relation is bounded, given
   an infinite number of executions of the schedule.
   <li>Deadlock will never occur, given and infinite number of executions of
   the schedule.
   </ul>
   <h1>Class comments</h1>
   An PDFDirector is the class that controls execution of actors under the
   PDF domain.  By default, actor scheduling is handled by the PDFScheduler
   class.  Furthermore, the newReceiver method creates Receivers of type
   PDFReceiver, which extends QueueReceiver to support optimized gets
   and puts of arrays of tokens.
   <p>
   The PDF director has a single parameter, "iterations", corresponding to a
   limit on the number of times the director will fire its hierarchy
   before it returns false in postfire.  If this number is not greater
   than zero, then no limit is set and postfire will always return true.
   The default value of the iterations parameter is an IntToken with value zero.
