kernel tests:

*OrCyclic - true is fed into a logical or, and the result is complemented and fed back into the logical or (all values should converge).

*OrCyclicUndefined - false is fed into a logical or, and the result is complemented and fed back into the logical or (some values should remain unknown).

*PulseOr - a logical or is performed on tokens from two pulses (would be good to test that Pulse1 produces no token at time 2.0)

*PulseSum - tokens from two pulses are added together (would be good to test that Pulse1 produces no token at time 2.0)

RampDoublePeriod - tokens from a ramp are squared (the period of the director is a double)

RampFiringLimit - tokens from two ramps are added together (one has a firing limit)

RampIntPeriod - tokens from a ramp are squared (the period of the director is an int)

Ramps - tokens from two ramps are added together



lib tests:

*Delay - tokens from a ramp are delayed by either 0, 1, or 2 instants (need to test for "no token")

*Latch - tokens from a ramp are distributed to three channels, and the tokens are latched (need to test for "no token")

*TriggeredTime - tokens from a ramp are distributed to three channels, which trigger the TriggeredTime actor (need to test for "no token")
