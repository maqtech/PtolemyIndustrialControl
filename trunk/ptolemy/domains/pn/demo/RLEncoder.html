PN Simulation:</H3>
The following applet uses the Ptolemy II Process Networks (PN) domain
to simulate a simple run length encoder that performs the encoding on a 
black and white image.

This demo reads an image in the portable-bitmap (pbm) format and converts it
into a integer matrix. This matrix is then converted into a single stream of 
integers. Runlength encoding is performed on this stream of integers. After 
compression, the stream is then uncompressed into a single stream of integers
which is then converted into a matrix and then an image. Both the input and
the output images are displayed on the screen. <p>

For the purpose of this demo, the scheme choosen for the runlength encoding is
quite simple. Since the input is a black and white image, it is treated as 
a binary matrix with every pixel represented as a bit (1 for black and 0 for 
white, as in the pbm format). The matrix once converted into a stream is then
treated as a stream of bits. The runlength encoder counts the number of times
the same bit appears in the stream. It uses 1 byte to indicate the value of 
the bit and the number of times the bit occured continuously (upto a count of 
128). If the bit occured more than 128 times, then a new byte is used to 
indicate the value and the count for the rest of the stream. The decoder does 
the exact opposite and generates a stream of bits corresponding to the input
byte stream. <p>

Both the input and the output images are displayed on the screen. <P>
