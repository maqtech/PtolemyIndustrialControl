This demo uses the Process Network Domain in Ptolemy II 
to find primes by using the sieve of Eratosthenes.
<p> To run the demo, you must be viewing this file with Tycho
and have Tcl Blend installed locally.  Click on the Tcl code below to
build and run the Universe.  Note that there will be a short delay
while the Tcl Blend backend starts up.
<p>
<tcl><pre>
source [file join $TYCHO java pt domains pn kernel demo PNPrimeTycho.tcl] 
PNPrimeTycho 50
</pre></tcl>
<h2>What you should see</h2>
<ul>
<li> In the Tycho Console, you should see messages from the run.
<li> The first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that is displayed shows the 
structure of the Entities that make up the Universe before it is run.
<li> The Second DAG that is displayed shows the 
structure of the Entities that make up the Universe after it is run.
<li> The nodes of both DAGs are mouse sensitive.  If you double click
on a node, a window that describes the node will appear.
</ul>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<a href="PNPrimeTycho.tcl"><code>PNPrimeTycho.tcl</code></a> is
a Tcl file that is sourced by Tycho.  This file starts up Tcl Blend
Process via the Tycho JRPC interface.
<p> The Tcl Blend Process sources
<a href="PNPrimeExample.tcl"><code>PNPrimeExample.tcl</code></a>, which
contains Tcl Blend commands that build the universe and run it.
The universe uses classes in
<a href="../"><code>$TYCHO/java/pt/domains/pn/kernel</code></a> to 
implement the Process Network domain.
<h2>The Example System</h2>
To view a DAG representation of the Ptolemy II kernel document example system,
click on the Tcl code below:
