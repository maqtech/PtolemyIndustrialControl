/**
This is the base class for the directors that govern the execution of a
CompositeActor with Kahn process networks (PN) semantics. This base class
attaches the Kahn-McQueen process networks semantics to a composite actor.
This base class does not support mutations although it provides the basic
infrastructure for mutations. The derived directors can use this
infrastructure to support mutations.
<p>
The thread that calls the various execution methods (initialize, prefire, fire
and postfire) on the director is referred to as the <i>directing thread</i>.
This directing thread might be the main thread reponsible for the execution
of the entire simulation or might be the thread created by the executive
director of the containing composite actor.
<p>
In the PN domain, the director creates a thread (an instance of
ProcessThread) representing a Kahn process, for each actor in the model.
The threads are created in initialize() and started in the prefire() method
of the ProcessDirector. A process is considered <i>active</i> from its
creation until its termination. An active process can block when trying to
read from a channel (<i>read-blocked</i>) or when trying to write to a channel
(<i>write-blocked</i>). Derived directors can define additional ways in which
active processes can block.
<p>
A <i>deadlock</i> is when all the active processes are blocked.
The director is responsible for handling deadlocks during execution.
This director handles two different sorts of deadlocks, <i>real deadlock</i>
and <i>artificial deadlock</i>. Derived directors might introduce additional
forms of deadlock.
<p>
A real deadlock is when all the processes are blocked on a read meaning that
no process can proceed until it receives new data. The execution can be
terminated, if desired, in such a situation. If the container of this director
does not have any input ports (as is in the case of a top-level composite
actor), then the executive director or manager terminates the execution.
If the container has input ports, then it is upto the
executive director of the container to decide on the termination of the
execution. To terminate the execution after detection of a real deadlock, the
manager or the executive director calls wrapup() on the director.
<p>
An artificial deadlock is when all processes are blocked and at least one
process is blocked on a write. In this case the director increases the
capacity of the receiver with the smallest capacity amongst all the
receivers on which a process is blocked on a write.
This breaks the deadlock and the execution can resume.
<p>
This base director does not support any form of mutations or topology changes
but provides the basic infrastructure in the form of methods that the derived
directors can use.
<p>
This director also permits pausing of the execution. An execution is paused
when all active processes are blocked or paused (at least one process is
paused). In case of PN, a process can be paused only when it tries to
communicate with other processes. Thus a process can be paused in the get()
or put() methods of the receivers alone. If there is a process that does
not communicate with other processes in the model, then the execution can
never pause in that model.
<p>
Though this class defines and uses a event-listener mechanism for notifying
the listeners of the various states a process is in, this mechanism is expected
to change to a great extent in the later versions of this class. A developer
must keep that in mind while building applications by using this mechanism. It
is highly recommended that the user do not use this mechanism as the future
changes might not be compatible with the current listener mechanism.<p>
