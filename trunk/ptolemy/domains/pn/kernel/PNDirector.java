/**
   A PNDirector governs the execution of a CompositeActor with extended
   Kahn-MacQueen process networks (PN) semantics. This model of computation has
   been extended to support mutations of graphs in a non-deterministic way.
   <p>
   The thread that calls the various execution methods (initialize, prefire, fire
   and postfire) on the director is referred to as the <i>directing thread</i>.
   This directing thread might be the main thread responsible for the execution
   of the entire simulation or might be the thread created by the executive
   director of the containing composite actor.
   <p>
   In the PN domain, the director creates a thread (an instance of
   ProcessThread), representing a Kahn process, for each actor in the model.
   The threads are created in initialize() and started in the prefire() method
   of the ProcessDirector. A process is considered <i>active</i> from its
   creation until its termination. An active process can block when trying to
   read from a channel (read-blocked), when trying to write to a channel
   (write-blocked) or when waiting for a queued topology change request to be
   processed (mutation-blocked).
   <p>
   A <i>deadlock</i> is when all the active processes are blocked.
   The director is responsible for handling deadlocks during execution.
   This director handles two different sorts of deadlocks, <i>real deadlock</i>
   and <i>artificial deadlock</i>.
   <p>
   A real deadlock is when all the processes are blocked on a read meaning that
   no process can proceed until it receives new data. The execution can be
   terminated, if desired, in such a situation. If the container of this director
   does not have any input ports (as is in the case of a top-level composite
   actor), then the executive director or manager terminates the execution.
   If the container has input ports, then it is up to the
   executive director of the container to decide on the termination of the
   execution. To terminate the execution after detection of a real deadlock, the
   manager or the executive director calls wrapup() on the director.
   <p>
   An artificial deadlock is when all processes are blocked and at least one
   process is blocked on a write. In this case the director increases the
   capacity of the receiver with the smallest capacity amongst all the
   receivers on which a process is blocked on a write.
   This breaks the deadlock and the execution can resume.
   If the increase results in a capacity that exceeds the value of
   <i>maximumQueueCapacity</i>, then instead of breaking the deadlock,
   an exception is thrown.  This can be used to detect erroneous models
   that require unbounded queues.
