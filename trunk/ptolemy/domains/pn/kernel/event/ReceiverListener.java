/**
A ReceiverListener is able to receive ReceiverEvents that are issued
during the execution of a process by a ProcessThread or director in PN.
In general, an object that implements this interface will probably be a front
end such as a execution visualization tool for
the Ptolemy II system, or an object that is communicating with a front end.
