This demo application was written for the early access implementation of
Sun's Java Sound API. To compile, edit the makefile to point to the
location of sound.jar in the Java Sound installation. To run, edit
runapp_solaris if using Solaris or runapp_windows.bat if using Windows.

The demo can then be run by typing:
./runapp_solaris AudioSinkDemo

or

./runapp_windows.bat AudioSinkDemo

No user input is required, just wait and listen for a short tone.

Notes/issues: This demo runs very slow (about 500 samples/sec on a Sun
Ultra 1). Rewriting AudioSink to read an array of samples at a time
rather than a single DoubleToken at a time could speed things up. Also,
the current NewAudio class uses a the java.util.LinkedList for the
audio queue, and needs to allocate a new node for every sample added to
the queue.
