//// RaisedCosine
/**
This actor implements an FIR filter with
a raised cosine or square-root raised cosine frequency response.
The excess bandwidth is given
by <i>excessBW</i> and the symbol interval (in number of samples)
by <i>interpolation</i> (which by default is 16).
The length of the filter (the number of taps) is given by <i>length</i>.
<p>
For the ordinary raised cosine response,
the impulse response of the filter would ideally be
<pre>
       sin(pi n/T)   cos(alpha pi n/T)
h(n) = ----------- * -----------------
         pi n/T      1-(2 alpha n/T)<sup>2</sup>
</pre>
where <i>alpha</i> is <i>excessBW</i> and <i>T</i> is the
<i>interpolation</i> factor.
However, this pulse is centered at zero, and we can only implement causal
filters in the SDF domain in Ptolemy.  Hence, the impulse response is
actually
<pre>
g(n) = h(n - M)
</pre>
where <i>M</i> = <i>length/</i>2 if <i>length</i> is even, and <i>M
</i>= (<i>length+</i>1)<i>/</i>2 if <i>length</i> is odd.
The impulse response is simply truncated outside this range, so
the impulse response will generally not be symmetric if <i>length</i> is even
because it will have one more sample to the left than to the right of center.
Unless this extra sample is zero, the filter will not have linear phase
if <i>length</i> is even.
<p>
For the ordinary raised cosine response, the
distance (in number of samples) from the center
to the first zero crossing is given by <i>symbolInterval</i>.
For the square-root raised cosine response, a cascade of two identical
square-root raised cosine filters would be equivalent to a single
ordinary raised cosine filter.
<p>
The impulse response of the square-root raised cosine pulse is given by
<pre>
        4 alpha(cos((1+alpha)pi n/T)+Tsin((1-alpha)pi n/T)/(4n alpha/T))
h(n) = -----------------------------------------------------------------
                     pi sqrt(T)(1-(4 alpha n/T)<sup>2</sup>)
</pre>
This impulse response convolved with itself will, in principle, be equal
to a raised cosine pulse.  However, because of the abrupt rectangular
windowing of the pulse, with low excess bandwidth, this ideal is not
closely approximated except for very long filters.
<p>
The output sample rate is <i>interpolation</i> times the input.
This is set by default to 16 because in digital communication systems
this pulse is used for the line coding of symbols, and upsampling is necessary.
Typically, the value of <i>interpolation</i> is the same as that of
<i>symbolInterval</i>, at least when the filter is being used
as a transmit pulse shaper.
