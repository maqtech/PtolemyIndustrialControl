//// DotProduct
/**
An actor that computes the dot product of two arrays.
This actor has two input ports, from which it receives two MatrixTokens.
The output is the dot product of the two matrices, assuming that each
matrix only has one row.
<p>
This actor is strict. That is, it requires that each input
port have a token upon firing. It always sends one DoubleToken as
its output.
