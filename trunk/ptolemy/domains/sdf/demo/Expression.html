<H1>Expression Evaluation</H1>
The following applet evaluates the expression in the box, which is a function
of two ramp signals, <i>slow</i> and <i>fast</i>.

The block diagram is as shown below, where the expression is a parameter
of the Expression block:

The <i>slow</i> signal is a ramp that starts at zero and increments by
PI/100 on each firing. The <i>fast</i> signal is a ramp that starts
at zero and increments by PI/10 on each firing.
Try changing the expression in the box to "cos(slow)*cos(fast)"
and clicking on the "Go" button.
Other interesting alternatives include:
<UL>
<LI> "cos(fast*cos(slow))"
<LI> "0.2*slow + cos(fast)"
</UL>
