/**
A SetRefinementVariable action takes the token from evaluating the
expression specified by the <i>expression</i> attribute and sets the
value of the instance of Variable specified by the <i>variableName</i>
attribute with the token. This action is a commit action contained by
a transition in an FSMActor, which will be called the associated
FSMActor of this action. The variable set by this action must be
contained by the refinement of the destination state of the transition
containing this action or an entity deeply contained by the refinement,
otherwise an exception is thrown when this action is executed. The
<i>variableName</i> attribute specifies the name of the variable
relative to the refinement. The scope of the specified expression
includes all the variables and parameters contained by the associated
FSMActor.
