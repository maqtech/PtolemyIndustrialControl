/**
This class implements the Port-based object model of computation.
This model of computation is not data driven, like most of the other
ptolemy domains.  Instead, it relies on analysis and user tuning of the
scheduling to ensure that no important data is lost (or that lost data is
not critical to the execution of the system.  This gives good real-time
performance, and this model of computation is often used in embedded control
systems.

Communication between port-based objects is *NOT* based on FIFO queues!
Instead, the processes have a concept of a shared memory.   The shared
memory is synchronized across processes that may be executing concurrently,
so that an object is always guaraunteed to have the most recent consistent
available state of its inputs when it fires.   Note that in this communication
model, data may be lost!

Port-based objects are normally associated with independant processes.
However,
unlike Process Networks, the threads are time-driven, instead of data-driven.
Each actor has an associated firing period, which determines how often
it will execute.  When a process is scheduled, it reads the current state
of its input ports, performs calculation, and then sets the state of its
output ports.   Because of this model, the calculated output during any
firing is dependant on the arrival of events, which results in
non-deterministic output.  Some effort must be expended at some point in the
design of a system using this domain in properly choosing the firing
periods of each actor.

Instead of associating a process with each actor, this director manually
schedules the actors.  This can be useful for simulating execution on
a target architecture that is different from the development machine.  In the
future, a director based on actor/process could be developed that would allow
the fastest execution on a given architecture.

The scheduling of actors is purposefully handled in an informal way.  Each
actor specifies its firing period through the "firingPeriod" parameter.  The
scheduler attempts to fire the actor every time that period expires.
This director implements a very simple scheduler, and just fires the actor.
This is sufficient, since only zero-delay actors are currently supported.
If delays are allowed, then more complex schedulers are preferable, since
some actors may require a very low latency when they are fired.  In such a case
priority scheduling of various kinds is probably necessary.

This director maintains a calendar queue of all the actors in the
simulation, and fires them in the order given by the queue.  This director
creates receivers of class PBOReceiver, which implements the shared memory
communication.

Only zero-delay actors are currently supported.  (This is bogus.  The
scheduling should be frequent enough that actors have a significant latency.
Also, when scheduling on a single processor, the processor is a resource that
must be distributed among all the actors.)
