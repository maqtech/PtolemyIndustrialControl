<h1>Star Charts</h1>
<P>
The Star Charts [1] domain implements hierarchical 
extended finite state machine (FSM) in Ptolemy II. 
FSM is a very intuitive and well-understood tool 
to model and specify discrete control logic. In the
Star Charts domain, states of an FSM can be hierarchically 
clustered to help specifying complex control logic.
When modeling a control component in a large system, the FSM 
model constructed in this domain can be embedded in
other domains in which the rest of the system are modeled. 
When modeling a modal system, states of an 
FSM model can be refined by subsystems in other domains, 
e.g. CT and DE. The behavior of this model is the behavior 
of its current subsystem (the subsystem refining its current 
state) plus state transitions triggered by external events 
or events detected in the current subsystem.
