/** An implementation of the ptolemy.actor.Receiver interface for
 *  the DE domain.  Tokens that are put into this receiver logically
 *  have time stamps. If the time stamp is not explicitly given using
 *  the setDelay() method,  then it is assumed to be the current time
 *  (which is maintained by the director).  The put() method sends
 *  the specified token to the director, which returns it to this receiver
 *  (via the protected method _triggerEvent()) when current time matches
 *  the time stamp of the token. The get() method returns only tokens
 *  that the director has so returned. Thus, when
 *  a token is put into the receiver using put(), it does not become
 *  immediately available to the get() method.
 *  <p>
 *  By default, the time stamp of a token is the current time of the
 *  director when put() is called. To specify a time stamp in the
 *  future, call setDelay() prior to calling put(). This should be
 *  done in a synchronized manner, since there could be multiple
 *  thread running in this domain.
 *  <p>
 *  Before firing an actor, the director is expected to put at least one
 *  token into at least one of the receivers contained by the actor.
