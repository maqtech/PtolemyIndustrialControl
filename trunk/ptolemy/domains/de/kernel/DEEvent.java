/**
   This class defines the structure of events in Ptolemy II DE domain.
   Conceptually, an event in the Ptolemy II DE domain contains
   a token and a tag.  In addition, the event has a destination,
   which is an actor and possibly a receiver (for non-pure events).
   A pure event has no destination receiver and no token, so methods
   for accessing those return null.
   The tag consists of a time stamp, a microstep, and a depth.
   The microstep represents the phase of execution
   when processing simultaneous events in directed loops, or when an
   actor schedules itself for firing later at the current time
   (using fireAt()).
   The depth is the index of the destination actor in a topological
   sort.  A larger value of depth represents a lower priority when
   processing events.
   <p>
   The time stamp, microstep, and depth are compared in that order by the
   compareTo() method from the Comparable interface.
