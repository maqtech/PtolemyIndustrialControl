/**
This class implements the structure of events in Ptolemy II DE domain.
Conceptually, an event in the Ptolemy II DE domain contains
a token and a tag.  In addition, the event has a destination,
which is an actor and possibly a receiver (for non-pure events).
A pure event has no destination receiver and no token, so methods
for accessing those return null.
The tag consists of a time stamp, a microstep, and a depth.
The microstep represents the phase of execution
when processing simultaneous events in directed loops, or when an
actor schedules itself for firing later at the current time
(using fireAt()).
The depth is the index of the destination actor in a topological
sort.  A larger value of depth represents a lower priority when
processing events.
<p>
This class implements the Comparable interface.  The time stamp,
microstep, and depth are compared in that order by the compareTo()
method.
