/**
   This director extends DE director and handles hierarchical DE models.
   <p>
   This director uses FunctionDependencies, which specify the input and output
   relations of an actor, to do topological sort and scheduling. This director
   excludes the models with cyclic loops in the graph composed of IO ports
   of actors, and throws an exception complaining that no valid schedules
   can be found.
   <p>
   Note that the pure events are treated differently in DEDirector and this
   director. In DEDirector, the pure event has the same depth with the actor
   requesting refiring. This may delay the event passing when the event has
   to pass across hierarchy boundary. The current solution is to make the pure
   events highest priority (0) and they will be processed at the very beginning
   of each iteration. For simultaneous pure events, they will be processed
   based on the order they are inserted into the event queue, which reflects
   the topological order of the actors producing these pure events.
   <p>
   Another interesting point was pointed out by Steve, that the equivalence
   of the send method of Delay actor and the fireAt method of general actor
   on breaking the loop. A simple but intuitive example is an opaque composite
   actor with a Delay actor embedded inside.
