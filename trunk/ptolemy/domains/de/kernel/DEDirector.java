/** This director implements the discrete-event model of computation (MoC).
 *  It should be used as the local director of a CompositeActor that is
 *  to be executed according to this MoC. This director maintain a notion
 *  of current time, and processes events chronologically in this time.
 *  An <i>event</i> is a token with a time stamp.  Much of the sophistication
 *  in this director is aimed at handling simultaneous events intelligently,
 *  so that deterministic behavior can be achieved.
 *  <p>
 *  The bottleneck in a typical DE simulator is in the maintenance of the
 *  global event queue. By default, a DE director uses the calendar queue
 *  as the global event queue. This is an efficient algorithm
 *  with O(1) time complexity in both enqueue and dequeue operations.
 *  <p>
 *  Sorting in the CalendarQueue class is done according to the order
 *  defined by the DEEvent class, which implements the java.lang.Comparable
 *  interface. A DE event has a time stamp (double), a microstep (integer)
 *  and a depth (integer). The time stamp
 *  indicates the time when the event occurs, the microstep indicates the
 *  phase of execution at a fixed time, and the depth
 *  indicates the relative priority of events with the same time stamp
 *  (simultaneous events).  The depth is determined by topologically
 *  sorting the actors according to data dependencies over which there
 *  is no time delay.
 *  <p>
 *  Ports in the DE domain may be instances of DEIOPort. The DEIOPort class
 *  should be used whenever an actor introduces time delays between the
 *  inputs and the outputs. When an ordinary IOPort is used, the director
 *  assumes, for the purpose of calculating priorities, that the delay
 *  across the actor is zero. On the other hand, when DEIOPort is used,
 *  the delay across the actor can be declared to be non-zero by calling
 *  the delayTo() method.
 *  <p>
 *  Input ports in a DE model contain instances of DEReceiver.
 *  When a token is put into a DEReceiver, that receiver enqueues the
 *  event by calling the _enqueueEvent() method of this director.
 *  This director sorts all such events in a global event queue
 *  (a priority queue).
 *  <p>
 *  Directed loops with no delay actors are not permitted; they would make it
 *  impossible to assign priorities.  Such a loop can be broken by inserting
 *  an instance of the Delay actor.  If zero delay around the loop is
 *  truly required, then simply set the <i>delay</i> parameter of that
 *  actor to zero.
 *  <p>
 *  At the beginning of the fire() method, this director dequeues
 *  a subset of the oldest events (the ones with smallest time
 *  stamp, microstep, and depth) from the global event queue,
 *  and puts those events into
 *  their corresponding receivers. The actor(s) to which these
 *  events are destined are the ones to be fired.  The depth of
 *  an event is the depth of the actor to which it is destined.
 *  The depth of an actor is its position in a topological sort of the graph.
 *  The microstep is usually zero, but is incremented when a pure event
 *  is queued with time stamp equal to the current time.
 *  <p>
 *  The actor that is fired must consume tokens from
 *  its input port(s), and will usually produce new events on its output
 *  port(s). These new events will be enqueued in the global event queue
 *  until their time stamps equal the current time.  It is important that
 *  the actor actually consume tokens from its inputs, because it will
 *  be fired repeatedly until there are no more tokens in its input
 *  ports with the current time stamp.  Alternatively, if the actor
 *  returns false in prefire(), then it will not be invoked again
 *  in the same iteration even if there are events in its receivers.
 *  <p>
 *  Execution of a DE model ends when the time stamp of the oldest events
 *  exceeds a preset stop time. This stopping condition is checked inside
 *  the prefire() method of this director. By default, execution also ends
 *  when the global event queue becomes empty. Sometimes, the desired
 *  behaviour is for the director to wait on an empty queue until another
 *  thread makes new events available.  For example, a DE actor may produce
 *  events when a user hits a button on the screen. To prevent ending the
 *  execution when there are no more events, call
 *  stopWhenQueueIsEmpty() with argument <code>false</code>.
 *  <p>
 *  The DE director has a parameter, "stopTime".  The stop
 *  time can be set using that parameter, or by directly calling
 *  setStopTime().  If the stop time is not explicitly set, then it
 *  defaults to Double.MAX_VALUE, resulting in a model that stops
 *  only when the model time reaches that (rather large) number.
 *  <p>
 *  If the parameter <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is set to <code>true</code>,
 *  then the director not process events until the real time elapsed
 *  since the model started matches the time stamp of the event.
 *  This ensures that the director does not get ahead of real time,
 *  but, of course, it does not ensure that the director keeps up with
 *  real time.
 *  <p>
 *  This director tolerates changes to the model during execution.
 *  The change should be queued with the director or manager using
 *  requestChange().  While invoking those changes, the method
 *  invalidateSchedule() is expected to be called, notifying the director
 *  that the topology it used to calculate the priorities of the actors
 *  is no longer valid.  This will result in the priorities being
 *  recalculated the next time prefire() is invoked.
 *  <p>
 *  However, there is one subtlety.  If an actor produces events in the
 *  future via DEIOPort, then the destination actor will be fired even
 *  if it has been removed from the topology by the time the execution
 *  reaches that future time.  This may not always be the expected behavior.
 *  The Delay actor in the DE library behaves this way.
