//// PreemptableTask
/**
This actor simulates a preemptable task.  The <i>executionTime</i>
parameter specifies the time it takes to execute the task.  Tokens
received on the <i>input</i> port correspond to invocations of the
task.

When a token is received on the <i>input</i> port, the token is stored
in the actor and the actor is scheduled to fire at
<i>executionTime</i> time units later.  When the <i>interrupt</i> port
receives a token, and the value is true, this task is "preempted."
Later, when the value of the token on the <i>interrupt</i> port
becomes false, the elapsed time is calculated and added to the
execution time of the task.  The actor is scheduled to fire at this
new execution time.  The saved token is emitted when the new execution
time has passed.  Subsequent input tokens are queued until the actor
is done processing the current input token, in which case the actor is
scheduled to fire at the current time to respond to the next task
invocation in the queue.
