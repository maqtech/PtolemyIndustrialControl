/**
   A data object that represents the communication "packet" transferred
   between MEMSDevice.  It is an abstract class which should be extended
   by subclasses that represent specify message types (eg thermoAlarmMsg
   MEMS messages)

   A standard packet should have the following information:

   Adjacent Source ID (ASID) = The ID of the MEMSDevice last forwarded
   the current packet.

   Source ID (SID) = The ID of the original MEMSDevice that generated
   the current packet.

   Destination ID (DID) = The ID of the current packet's destination
   MEMSDevice.

   Message ID = An unique message ID number (to be assigned internally by this class.
