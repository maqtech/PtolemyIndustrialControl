<P>
The above applet uses the Ptolemy II Discrete Event (DE) domain
to illustrate the inspection paradox.
The inspection paradox concerns Poisson arrivals of events.
The metaphor used in this applet is that of busses and passengers.
Passengers arrive according to a Poisson process.
Busses arrive either at regular intervals or according to a Poisson
process.  The user selects from these two options by clicking the
appropriate on-screen control.  The user can also control the mean
interarrival time of both busses and passengers.
<p>
The inspection paradox concerns the average time that a passenger
waits for a bus (more precisely, the expected value).  If the busses
arrive at regular intervals with interarrival time equal to <i>T</i>,
then the expected waiting time is <i>T</i>/2, which is perfectly
intuitive.  Counterintuitively, however, if the busses arrive
according to a Poisson process with mean interarrival time equal
<i>T</i>, the expected waiting time is <i>T</i>, not <i>T</i>/2.
These expected waiting times are approximated in this applet by
the average waiting time.  The applet also shows that actual
arrival times for both passengers and busses, and the waiting
time of each passenger.
<p>
The top plot shows the passengers and buses arrival times. The bus
and passenger arrivals are shown with red and blue impulses. All passengers
arriving before and at the time bus <I>i</I> arrives and after the time
bus <I>i-1</I> arrives will get on bus <I>i</I>. On each bus arrival, all
passengers getting on that bus report their waiting times. The waiting times
are plotted on the same plot using cyan impulses.
The bottom plot shows the distribution histogram of all wait times.
The bin width used is equal to 0.2.
<P>
You can interact with the applet by choosing one of the two bus arrival
time distributions, the stop time of the simulation, and the mean inter-arrival
time of the busses or passengers.
<p>
The intuition that resolves the paradox is as follows.
If the busses are arriving according to a Poisson process,
then some intervals between busses are larger than other intervals.
A particular passenger is more likely to arrive at the bus stop
during one of these larger intervals than during one of the smaller
intervals.  Thus, the expected waiting time is larger if the bus
arrival times are irregular.
<p>
This paradox is called the <i>inspection paradox</i> because the
passengers are viewed as inspecting the Poisson process of
bus arrivals.
