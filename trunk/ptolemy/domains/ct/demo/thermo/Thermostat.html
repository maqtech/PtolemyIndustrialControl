<H2>Introduction</H2>
This applet shows a simple thermostat system. The temperatur of the room
is expected to be controlled between 0 and 0.2
<p>
The system has two states, heating and cooling. In the heating state,
the temperature of the room is increased linearly, in terms of a differential
equation:
<pre>
<CODE>    dx/dt = 1</CODE>
</pre>
In the cooling state, the temperature is dropped linearly, i.e.
<pre>
<CODE>    dx/dt = -1</CODE>
</pre>
The control rule is that if the temperature reaches 0.2 degree, then swich
the controller to the cooling state; if the temperature decreases to 0 degree
then switch the controller to the heating state. 
<p>
We use this demo to illustrate the accuracy of detecting events, and the 
ability of simulating hybrid system in Ptolemy II.
