/**
Interface for actors that controls integration step sizes. Typically,
the step size of an integration algorithm is determined by the initial
step size parameter, the local truncation error at the integrators,
the discontinuity of actor behaviors, etc. All actors that want to
effect the integration step size should implement this interface.
<P>
Three methods are defined in this interface, isThisStepSuccessful(),
refinedStepSize(), and predictedStepSize(). At the end of each integration
step, the CTStepSizeControlActors will be asked whether this step is
successful. If one of the actor is not satisfied, then it will be asked
for a refined step size. The integration step will be restarted with
this refined step size. If all the step-size-control actors are satisfied,
they will be asked for the (predicted) next step size.
