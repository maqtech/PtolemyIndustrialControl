/**
This is a CTDirector that supports the interaction of the continuous-time
simulation with event-based domains. This director can both serve as
a top-level director and an inside director that is contained by
a composite actor in an event-based domain. If it is a top-level
director, it acts exactly like a CTMultiSolverDirector. If it is
embedded in another event-based domain, it will run ahead of the global
time and prepare to roll back if necessary.
<P>
This class has an extra parameter as compare to the CTMultiSolverDirector,
which is the maximum run ahead of time length (<code>runAheadLength</code>).
The default value is 1.0.
<P>
The running ahead of time is achieved by the following mechanism.<br>
<UL>
<LI> At the initialize stage of the execution, the director will request
a fire at the global current time.
<LI> At each prefire stage of the execution, the fire end time is computed
based on the current time of the executive director, t1, the next iteration
time of the executive director, t2, and the value of the parameter
<code>runAheadLength</code>, t3. The fire end time is t1+min(t2, t3)
<LI> At the prefire stage, the local current time is compared with the
current time of the executive director. If the local time is later than
the executive director time, then the directed system will rollback to a
"known good" state.
<LI> The "known good" state is the state of the system at the time when
local time is equal to the current time of the executive director.
<LI> At the fire stage, the director will stop at the first of the
following two times, the fire end time and the first detected event time.
</UL>
