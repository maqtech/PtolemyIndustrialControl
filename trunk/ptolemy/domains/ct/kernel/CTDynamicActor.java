/**
Interface of dynamic actors in the CT domain. Dynamic actors are actors
that have one or more integrators in their I/O relations.
Typically, integrators, analog filters, and anything that can be written
as<BR>
dx/dt = f(x, u, t)<BR>
y=g(x, u, t)<BR>
are dynamic actors. 
<P>
There is one method defined in this interface, which is
emitTentativeOutput(). The tentative output is the output of the actor
after each iteration (but before the states are updated). They are 
emitted for exciting the event generating and the output schedule.
The tentative output is the output if the current integration step is
acceptable. It may not be the "real" output, if there is an "missed" event 
reported by some event detectors.
