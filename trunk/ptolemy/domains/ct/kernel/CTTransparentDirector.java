/**
Interface for CT transparent directors. Transparent directors in the CT
domain can transfer its internal step size control information to the
executive director. It defines methods to support the step size control
queries by the executive CTDirector, such that after the internal
CT subsystem finishes one integration step, its step size control information
will be accessible by the outside CT director.
<P>
Implementations of this interface are typically contained by CTCompositeActors.
