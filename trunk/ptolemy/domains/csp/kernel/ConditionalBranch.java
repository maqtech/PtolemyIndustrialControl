/**
 Base class for classes representing guarded communication statements. A
 guarded communication statement is of the form
 <P>
 <CENTER>guard; communication => statements </CENTER>
 <P>
 If the guard is true, or absent which implies true, then the branch
 is enabled. Guarded communication statements are used to perform
 both forms of conditional communication constructs: "conditional if" (CIF)
 and "conditional do" (CDO). These constructs are analogous to,
 but different from, the common <I>if</I> and <I>do</I> statements.
 Each guarded communication statement is one branch of a CIF or CDO.
 <p>
 A CDO has the form
 <P>
 CDO {
 <br>G1; C1 => S1;
 <br>[]
 <br>G2; C2 => S2;
 <br>[]
 <br>...
 <br>}
 <P>
 The G1, G2 etc. represent the guards. The C1, C2 etc. represent the
 communication associated with that branch, and may be either a send()
 or a get(). The S1, S2 etc. represent the blocks of statements
 associated with that branch. They are executed if that branch is
 successful. The "[]" hints at the fact that the guards are all evaluated
 in parallel (as opposed to sequentially in a common <I>if</I> statement).
 <p>
 While at least one of the branches is enabled, the construct continues
 to evaluate and execute one of the enabled branches. If more than one
 branch is enabled, the first branch to be able to rendezvous succeeds
 and its statements are executed. Note that this construct is
 nondeterministic as it may be  a race condition that determines
 which branch is successful. The CIF is similar to the CDO except that
 it is only evaluated once.
 <p>
 The communication part of a guarded communication statement can be
 either a send() or a get(). There are thus two subclasses of this
 class, each representing a guarded communication statement for one of
 the communication primitives. The subclasses are ConditionalSend and
 ConditionalReceive.
 <p>
 If more than one branch is enabled, each enabled branch is executed
 in a separate thread. For rendezvous, the receiver is the key
 synchronization point.
 <p>
 Conditional branches are designed to be used once. Upon instantiation,
 they are given the guard, the port and channel over which to communicate,
 and the identification number of the branch according to the controller.
 The port and the channel together define the CSPReceiver with which to
 rendezvous. The ConditionalBranchController, that controls this branch,
 is assumed to be contained by the container of the port.
