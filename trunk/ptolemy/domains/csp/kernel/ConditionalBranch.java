/**
Base class for classes representing guarded communication statements. A
guarded communication statement is of the form
<P>
      <CENTER>guard; communication => statements </CENTER>
<P>
If the guard is true, or absent which implies true, then the branch
is enabled. Guarded communication statements are used to perform
both forms of conditional communication constructs: "conditional if" (CIF)
and "conditional do" (CDO). These constructs are analogous to,
but different from, the common <I>if</I> and <I>do</I> statements.
Each guarded communication statement is one branch of a CIF or CDO.
<p>
A CDO has the form
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp                              CDO {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       G1; C1 => S1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp                          []
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       G2; C2 => S2;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp                          []
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       ...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp                          }
<P>
The G1, G2 etc. represent the guards. The C1, C2 etc. represent the
communication associated with that branch, and may be either a send()
or a get(). The S1, S2 etc. represent the blocks of statements
associated with that branch. They are executed if that branch is
successful. The "[]" hints at the fact that the guards are all evaluated
in parallel (as opposed to sequentially in a common <I>if</I> statement).
<p>
While at least one of the branches is enabled, the construct continues
to evaluate and execute one of the enabled branches. If more than one
branch is enabled, the first branch to be able to rendezvous succeeds
and its statements are executed. Note that this construct is
nondeterministic as it may be  a race condition that determines
which branch is successful. The CIF is similar to the CDO except that
it is only evaluated once.
<p>
The communication part of a guarded communication statement can be
either a send() or a get(). There are thus two subclasses of this
class, each representing a guarded communication statement for one of
the communication primitives. The subclasses are ConditionalSend and
ConditionalReceive.
<p>
If more than one branch is enabled, each enabled branch is executed
in a separate thread. For rendezvous, the receiver is the key
synchronization point.
<p>
Conditional branches are designed to be used once. Upon instantiation,
they are given the guard, the port and channel over which to communicate,
and the identification number of the branch according to the parent.
The port and the channel together define the CSPReceiver with which to
rendezvous. The CSPActor, executing a CIF or CDO that contains this branch, is
assumed to be the container of the port.
<p>
FIXME: perhaps make the access methods protected?
