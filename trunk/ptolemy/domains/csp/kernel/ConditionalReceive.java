//// ConditionalReceive
/**
Represents a <I>guarded communication statement</I> in which the
communication is a get(). Thus it represents
<P>
     <CENTER> guard; get() => statements</CENTER>
<P>
It is one branch of either a CDO or a CIF conditional
communication construct.
<p>
The branches used in a conditional communication construct are
controlled by the chooseBranch() method of ConditionalBranchController.
<p>
Each branch is created to perform one communication. If more than
one branch is enabled (the guard is true or absent), then a thread
is created for each enabled branch to try and perform
the appropriate rendezvous. If the branch
succeeds and is allowed to rendezvous, then it registers itself with
the controller and the thread it is running in dies. Otherwise it
continues to try and rendezvous until it succeeds or it is notified that
another branch has succeeded in with its rendezvous, in which case this
branch has failed and the thread it is running in dies.
<p>
For rendezvous, the receiver is the key synchronization point. The
receiver with which this branch will try to rendezvous is set upon
instantiation. It is determined from the port and channel which is
passed in in the constructor.
<p>
The algorithm by which a branch determines whether or not it has
succeeded with its rendezvous is executed in the run method. There are
roughly three parts to the algorithm, each of which is relevant
to the different rendezvous scenarios.
<br>
<I>Case 1:</I> Realized by _arriveAfterPut(). There is a put already waiting
at the rendezvous point. In this case
the branch attempts to register itself, with the controller, as the first
branch ready to rendezvous. If it succeeds, it performs the rendezvous,
notifies the controller that it succeeded and returns. If it is not the first,
it keeps on trying to register itself until it finally succeeds or another
branch successfully rendezvoused in which case it fails and terminates. Note
that a put cannot "go away" so it remains in an inner-loop trying to
rendezvous or failing.
<br>
<I>Case 2:</I> Realized by _arriveAfterConditionalSend(). There is a conditional send
waiting. In this case it tries to register both branches with their
controllers as the first to try. If it
succeeds it performs the transfer, notifies the controller and returns. It
performs the registration in two steps, first registering this branch and
then registering the other branch. If it successfully registers this branch,
but cannot register the other, it unregisters itself as the first branch
trying, and starts trying to rendezvous from the beginning. This is because
the conditional send could "go away". If it is unable to register itself as
the first branch to try, it again starts trying to rendezvous from the
beginning.
<br>
<I>Case 3:</I> Realized by _arriveFirst(). If there is neither a put or a
conditional send waiting, it sets a
flag in the receiver that a conditional receive is trying to rendezvous. It
then waits until a put is executed on the receiver, or until another branch
succeeds and this branch fails. If this branch fails, it resets the flag in
the receiver, notifies the controller and returns. Note that it only needs
to wait on a put as if a conditional send is executed on the receiver, it is
the branch which is responsible for checking that the rendezvous can proceed.
Thus, in the case where two conditional branches are trying to rendezvous
at a receiver, it is the responsibility of the branch arriving second to
check that the rendezvous can proceed(see case 2).
