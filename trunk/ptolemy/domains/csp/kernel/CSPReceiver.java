/**
Receiver for CSP style communication. For rendezvous, the receiver is the key
synchronization point. It is assumed each receiver has at most one
thread trying to send to it and at most one thread trying to receive
from it at any one time. The receiver performs the synchronization
necessary for simple rendezvous (get() and put() operations). It
also stores the flags that allow conditionalSends and conditionalReceives
to know when they can proceed.
<p>
FIXME: If more than receiver or sender were allowed, what would this mean?
Is the synchronization below provable? Or is it just reasoned?
