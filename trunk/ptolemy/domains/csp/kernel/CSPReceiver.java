/**
Receiver for CSP style communication. In CSP all communication is via
synchronous message passing, so both the the sending and receiving
process need to rendezvous at the receiver. For rendezvous, the
receiver is the key synchronization point. It is assumed each receiver
has at most one thread trying to send to it and at most one thread
trying to receive from it at any one time. The receiver performs the
synchronization necessary for simple rendezvous (get() and put()
operations). It also stores the flags that allow the ConditionalSend
and ConditionalReceive branches to know when they can proceed.
