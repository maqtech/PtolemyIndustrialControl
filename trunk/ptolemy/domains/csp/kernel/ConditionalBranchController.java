//// ConditionalBranchController
/**
   A controller that manages the conditional branches for performing
   conditional communication within CSP (Communication Sequential Processes)
   domain. Any CSP actors (either atomic or composite) that need the
   functionality of conditional communication must contain and instantiate
   an object of this class. In addition, they also needs to implement the
   interface ConditionalBranchActor.
   <p>
   The conditional branches are supposed to be created within the parent
   actor that contains this controller.
   <p>The chooseBranch() method takes those branches (an array) as an
   argument, and controls which branch is successful. The successful
   branch is the branch that succeeds with its communication. To
   determine which branch is successful, the guards of <I>all</I>
   branches are checked. If the guard for a branch is true then that
   branch is <I>enabled</I>. If no branches are enabled, i.e. if all
   the guards are false, then -1 is returned to indicate this.  If
   exactly one branch is enabled, the corresponding communication is
   carried out and the identification number of the branch is
   returned.  If more than one branch is enabled, a separate thread is
   created and started for each enabled branch. The method then waits
   for one of the branches to succeed, after which it wakes up and
   terminates the remaining branches. When the last conditional branch
   thread has finished, the method returns allowing the parent actor
   thread to continue.
