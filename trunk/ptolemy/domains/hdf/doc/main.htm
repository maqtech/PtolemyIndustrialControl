<h1>Heterochronous Dataflow Domain</h1>
The Heterochronous Dataflow (HDF) Domain, created by Ye Zhou
is an optimization of the
SDFDirector and implements the HDF model of computation. The HDF
model of computation is a generalization of Synchronous Dataflow (SDF).
In SDF, the set of port rates of an actor (called rate signatures) are
constant. In HDF, however, rate signatures are allowed to change between
iterations of the HDF schedule. Within each state, the HDF model behaves
like an SDF model.
