//// HDFDirector
/**
The heterochronous dataflow (HDF) domain implements the HDF model
of computation [1]. The HDF model of computation is a generalization
of synchronous dataflow (SDF). In SDF, the set of port rates of an
actor (called the type signature) are constant. In HDF, however,
an actor has a finite number of type signatures which are allowed
to change between iterations of the HDF schedule.
<p>
An HDF actor has an initial type signature when execution begins.
The balance equations can then be solved to find a
periodic schedule, as in SDF. Unlike SDF, an HDF actor is allowed to
change its type signature after an iteration of the schedule.
If a port rate change occurs, a new schedule
corresponding to the new ports rates must then be obtained.
<p>
Since an HDF actor has a finite number of type signatures, it
may be useful to use an FSM to control when type signature changes
may occur. The HDFFSMDirector may be used to compose HDF with
 hierarchical FSMs according to the *charts [1] semantics.
<p>
Since an HDF actor has a finite number of possible type
signatures, the number of possible schedules is also finite.
As a result of this finite state space, deadlock and bounded
channel lengths are decidable in HDF. In principle, all possible
schedules could be computed at compile time. However, the number
of schedules can be exponential in the number of actors, so this
may not be practical.
<p>
This director makes use of an HDF scheduler that computes the
schedules dynamically, and caches them. The size of the cache
can be set by the <i>scheduleCacheSize</i> parameter. The default
value of this parameter is 100.
