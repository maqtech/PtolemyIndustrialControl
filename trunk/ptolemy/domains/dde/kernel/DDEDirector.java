//// DDEDirector
/**
A DDEDirector governs the execution of actors operating according
to the DDE model of computation (MoC). The DDE MoC incorporates
a distributed notion of time into a dataflow style communication
semantic. Blocking reads occur if attempts to consume data are
made when the corresponding receiver is empty and blocking writes
occur if attempts to produce data are made when the corresponding
receiver is full.
<P>
In conjunction with the blocking read/write facilities, the DDE
domain uses a distributed, local notion of time. In a network of
actors governed by a DDEDirector each actor has a local notion of
time. Several features of the DDEDirector are intended to facilitate
these local notions of time.
<P>
All DDE models have a completion time. The completion time is a preset
time after which all execution ceases. The completion time for a
DDEDirector is specified via the <I>stopTime</I> parameter. The value
of the stopTime parameter is passed to the receivers of all actors
that the DDEDirector governs via newReceiver() during initialize().
After initialize() has been called, the value of stopTime can not be
changed.
<P>
The default value of the stopTime parameter is
PrioritizedTimedQueue.ETERNITY. Given this value, a DDE model will
continue executing without regard for a completion time.
<P>
Deadlock due to feedback loops is dealt with via NullTokens. When an
actor in a DDE model receives a NullToken, it may advance its local
time value even though no computation results directly from
consumption of the NullToken. For models with feedback topologies,
the FeedBackDelay actor should be used in the feedback loop.
<P>
The DDE model of computation assumes that valid time stamps have
non-negative values. Three special purpose negative time values
are reserved with the following meanings. The value of
PrioritizedTimedQueue.INACTIVE is reserved to indicate the termination
of a receiver. The value of PrioritizedTimedQueue.ETERNITY is reserved
to indicate that a receiver has not begun to participate in a model's
execution. The value of PrioritizedTimedQueue.IGNORE is reserved to
indicate that the current token at the head of a DDEReceiver should
be ignored in favor of the tokens contained in the other receivers
of the actor in question. More details of IGNORE can be found in
FeedBackDelay.
<P>
NOTE: The current implementation of this director does not
include an infrastructure for mutations. Hence, ChangeRequest
and other facilities for changing the topology of a model are
not included in this director.
