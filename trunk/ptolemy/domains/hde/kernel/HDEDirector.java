/**
   This director implements the discrete-event model of computation (MoC)
   with memoried signals. It extends the  DE Director.
   It should be used as the local director of a CompositeActor that is
   to be executed according to this MoC. This director maintain a notion
   of current time, and processes events chronologically in this time.
   An <i>event</i> is a token with a time stamp.  Much of the sophistication
   in this director is aimed at handling simultaneous events intelligently,
   so that deterministic behavior can be achieved.
   <p>
   The bottleneck in a typical DE simulator is in the maintenance of the
   global event queue. By default, a DE director uses the calendar queue
   as the global event queue. This is an efficient algorithm
   with O(1) time complexity in both enqueue and dequeue operations.
   <p>
   Sorting in the CalendarQueue class is done according to the order
   defined by the DEEvent class, which implements the java.lang.Comparable
   interface. A DE event has a time stamp, a microstep, and a depth.
   The time stamp indicates the time when the event occurs.
   The microstep represents the phase of execution
   when processing simultaneous events in directed loops, or when an
   actor schedules itself for firing later at the current time
   (using fireAt()).
   The depth is the index of the destination actor in a topological
   sort.  A larger value of depth represents a lower priority when
   processing events.  The depth is determined by topologically
   sorting the actors according to data dependencies over which there
   is no time delay. Note that the zero-delay data dependencies are
   determined on a per port basis.
   <p>
   Ports in the DE domain may be instances of DEIOPort. The DEIOPort class
   should be used whenever an actor introduces time delays between the
   inputs and the outputs. When an ordinary IOPort is used, the director
   assumes, for the purpose of calculating priorities, that the delay
   across the actor is zero. On the other hand, when DEIOPort is used,
   the delay across the actor can be declared to be non-zero by calling
   the delayTo() method on output ports.
   <p>
   Directed loops with no delay actors are not permitted; they would make it
   impossible to assign priorities.  Such a loop can be broken by inserting
   an instance of the Delay actor.  If zero delay around the loop is
   truly required, then simply set the <i>delay</i> parameter of that
   actor to zero.
   <p>
   Input ports in a DE model contain instances of DEReceiver.
   When a token is put into a DEReceiver, that receiver enqueues the
   event to the director  by calling the _enqueueEvent() method of
   this director.
   This director sorts all such events in a global event queue
   (a priority queue).
   <p>The HDEDirector employs a special HDE receiver which stores
   the most recent values of the inputs of an actor and reapplies
   them whenever an actor input changes.
   <p>
   An iteration, in the DE domain, is defined as processing all
   the events whose time stamp equals to the current time of the director.
   At the beginning of the fire() method, this director dequeues
   a subset of the oldest events (the ones with smallest time
   stamp, microstep, and depth) from the global event queue,
   and puts those events into
   their destination receivers. The actor(s) to which these
   events are destined are the ones to be fired.  The depth of
   an event is the depth of the actor to which it is destined.
   The depth of an actor is its position in a topological sort of the graph.
   The microstep is usually zero, but is incremented when a pure event
   is queued with time stamp equal to the current time.
   <p>
   The actor that is fired must consume tokens from
   its input port(s), and will usually produce new events on its output
   port(s). These new events will be enqueued in the global event queue
   until their time stamps equal the current time.  It is important that
   the actor actually consume tokens from its inputs, even if the tokens are
   solely used to trigger reactions. This is how polymorphic actors are
   used in the DE domain. The actor will
   be fired repeatedly until there are no more tokens in its input
   ports with the current time stamp.  Alternatively, if the actor
   returns false in prefire(), then it will not be invoked again
   in the same iteration even if there are events in its receivers.
   <p>
   A model starts from the time specified by <i>startTime</i>, which
   has default value 0.0
   <P>
   The stop time of the execution can be set using the
   <i>stopTime</i> parameter. The parameter has default value
   Double.MAX_VALUE, which means the execution stops
   only when the model time reaches that (rather large) number.
   <P>
   Execution of a DE model ends when the time stamp of the oldest events
   exceeds a preset stop time. This stopping condition is checked inside
   the prefire() method of this director. By default, execution also ends
   when the global event queue becomes empty. Sometimes, the desired
   behaviour is for the director to wait on an empty queue until another
   thread makes new events available.  For example, a DE actor may produce
   events when a user hits a button on the screen. To prevent ending the
   execution when there are no more events, set the
   <i>stopWhenQueueIsEmpty</i> parameter to <code>false</code>.
   <p>
   Parameters, <i>isCQAdaptive</i>, <i>minBinCount</i>, and
   <i>binCountFactor</i>, are
   used to configure the calendar queue. Changes to these parameters
   are ignored when the model is running.
   <p>
   If the parameter <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is set to <code>true</code>,
   then the director not process events until the real time elapsed
   since the model started matches the time stamp of the event.
   This ensures that the director does not get ahead of real time,
   but, of course, it does not ensure that the director keeps up with
   real time.
   <p>
   This director tolerates changes to the model during execution.
   The change should be queued with a component in the hierarchy using
   requestChange().  While invoking those changes, the method
   invalidateSchedule() is expected to be called, notifying the director
   that the topology it used to calculate the priorities of the actors
   is no longer valid.  This will result in the priorities being
   recalculated the next time prefire() is invoked.
   <p>
   However, there is one subtlety.  If an actor produces events in the
   future via DEIOPort, then the destination actor will be fired even
   if it has been removed from the topology by the time the execution
   reaches that future time.  This may not always be the expected behavior.
   The Delay actor in the DE library behaves this way.
