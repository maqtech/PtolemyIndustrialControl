/**

A SchematicRelation represents a relation in a Ptolemy II schematic.
It contains links, which specify the topology of the schematic.
Every link has a name that specifies the unique port within a schematic that
it is connected to.   A link name is formed by period concatenating the
entity name and the port name that the link is connected to, such as
"entity.port".
<!-- schematic relations will be parsed into class SchemticRelation -->
<!ELEMENT relation (link)*>
<!ATTLIST relation
name ID #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT link EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST link
name CDATA #REQUIRED>
