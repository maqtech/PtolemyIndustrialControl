/** Computation of sink nodes in a graph.

A <em>sink node</em> in a graph is a node without output edges. The
<code>result</code> method (see {@link Analysis#result()})
of this analysis returns the sink nodes in the associated graph.
The sink nodes are returned in the form of a {@link java.util.Collection},
where each element in the collection is a {@link Node}. The collection
returned cannot be modified.
<p>
This analysis requires <em>O</em>(<em>N</em>) time, where <em>N</em> is the
number of nodes in the graph.
