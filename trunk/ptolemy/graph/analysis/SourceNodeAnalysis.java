/** Computation of source nodes in a graph.

    A <em>source node</em> in a graph is a node without input edges. The
    <code>result</code> method (see {@link Analysis#result()})
    of this analysis returns the source nodes in the associated graph.
    The source nodes are returned in the form of a {@link java.util.Collection},
    where each element in the collection is a {@link Node}. The collection
    returned cannot be modified.
    <p>
    This analysis requires <em>O</em>(<em>N</em>) time, where <em>N</em> is the
    number of nodes in the graph.
