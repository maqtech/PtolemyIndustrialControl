/** Computation of transitive closure in a directed graph.

<em>Transitive closure</em> is a reachability graph transformed from a given
graph. While there is a path directed from node X to Y in the given graph,
there is an edge from X to Y in the transformed graph. Generally, transitive
closure is expressed in terms of square matrix with graph node labels as
indices. The {@link #result()} method returns an <code>ArrayList</code> of
rows (also in <code>ArrayList</code>) to represent the matrix.

<p>
The implementation uses Warshall's algorithm, which can be found in chapter
6 of "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications," 3rd Ed., by K. H. Rosen.
The complexity of this algorithm is O(N^3), where N is the number of nodes.

<p>
Transitive closure is important in obtaining reachability information.
One application is to check if a graph is cyclic.
