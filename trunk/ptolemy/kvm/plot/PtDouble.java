     * <i>FloatValue</i>, then a <code>NumberFormatException</code> is

     * value in the usual "computerized scientific notation"; this exact 
     * decimal value is then conceptually converted to an "infinitely 
     * precise" binary value that is then rounded to type <code>double</code> 
     * by the usual round-to-nearest rule of IEEE 754 floating-point 
     * arithmetic. Finally, a new object of class <code>Double</code> is 
     * created to represent the <code>double</code> value. 
     *
     * @param      s   the string to be parsed.
     * @return     a newly constructed <code>Double</code> initialized to the
