//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//// Variable
/**
A variable is an attribute that contains a token, and can be set by an
expression that can refer to other variables.
<p>
A variable can be given a token or an expression as its value. To create
a variable with a token, either call the appropriate constructor, or create
the variable with the appropriate container and name, and then call
setToken(). To set the value from an expression, call setExpression().
The expression is not actually evaluated until you call getToken(),
propagate() or getType(). If the expression string is null or empty,
or if no value has been specified, then getToken() will return null.
<p>
Consider for example the sequence:
<pre>
   Variable v3 = new Variable(container,"v3");
   Variable v2 = new Variable(container,"v2");
   Variable v1 = new Variable(container,"v1");
   v3.setExpression("v1 + v2");
   v2.setExpression("1.0");
   v1.setExpression("2.0");
   v3.getToken();
</pre>
Notice that the expression for <code>v3</code> cannot be evaluated
when it is set because <code>v2</code> and <code>v1</code> do not
yet have values.  But there is no problem because the expression
is not evaluated until getToken() is called.  Equivalently, we
could have called, for example,
<pre>
   v1.propagate();
</pre>
This will force v1 to be evaluated, as well as all variables that
depend on v1.
<p>
The expression can only reference variables that are
added to the scope of this variable using addToScope()
before the expression is evaluated
(i.e., before getToken() is called). Otherwise, getToken() will throw
an exception.  By default, all variables
contained by the same container, and those contained by the container's
container, are in the scope of this variable. Thus, in the above,
all three variables are in each other's scope because they belong
to the same container. If there are variables in the scope with the
same name, then those lower in the hierarchy shadow those that are higher.
<p>
If a variable is referred
to by expressions of other variables, then the name of the variable must be a
valid identifier as defined by the Ptolemy II expression language syntax.
<p>
A variable is a Typeable object. Constraints on its type can be
specified relative to other Typeable objects (as inequalities on the types),
or relative to specific types.  The former are called <i>dynamic type
constraints</i>, and the latter are called <i>static type constraints</i>.
Static type constraints are specified by the methods:
<ul>
<li> setTypeEquals()
<li> setTypeAtMost()
</ul>
whereas dynamic type constraints are given by
<ul>
<li> setTypeAtLeast()
<li> setTypeSameAs()
</ul>
Static type constraints are enforced in this class, meaning that:
<ul>
<li> if the variable already has a value (set by setToken() or
     setExpression()) when you set the static type constraint, then
     the value must satisfy the type constraint; and
<li> if after setting a static type constraint you call give the token
     a value, then the value must satisfy the constraints.
</ul>
A violation will cause an exception (either when setToken() is called
or when the expression is evaluated).
<p>
The dynamic type constraints are not enforced in this class, but merely
reported by the typeConstraintList() method.  They must be enforced at a
higher level (by a type system) since they involve a network of variables
and other typeable objects.  In fact, if the variable does not yet have
a value, then a type system may use these constraints to infer what the
type of the variable needs to be, and then call setTypeEquals().
<p>
The token returned by getToken() is always an instance of the class given
by the getType() method.  This is not necessarily the same as the class
of the token that was inserted via setToken().  It might be a distinct
type if the token given by setToken() can be converted losslessly into one
of the type given by setTypeEquals().
<p>
A variable can also be reset. If the variable was originally set from a
token, then this token is placed again in the variable, and the type of the
variable is set to equal that of the token. If the variable
was originally given an expression, then this expression is placed again
in the variable (but not evaluated), and the type is reset to
BaseType.UNKNOWN.
The type will be determined when the expression is evaluated or when
type resolution is done.
<p>
A variable has no MoML description (MoML is an XML modeling markup
language).  Thus, a variable contained by a named object is not
persistent, in that if the object is exported to a MoML file, the
variable will not be represented.  If you prefer that the variable
be represented, then you should use the derived class Parameter instead.
<p>
A variable is also normally not settable by users from the user
interface.  This is because, by default, getVisibility() returns NULL.
The derived class Parameter is fully visible by default.
