//// StructuredType
/**
Base class for structured type. Making this an abstract class (not an
interface) allows the methods to be protected.
All the types of the same structured type (e.g. all the array types)
must form a lattice. Each instance of a structured type must know how
to compare itself with another instance of the same structured type,
and compute the least upper bound and greatest lower bound. This
interface defines methods for these operations.
<p>
Subclasses should override clone() to do a deep cloning.
