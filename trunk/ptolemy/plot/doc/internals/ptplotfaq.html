<DL>
<DT> <A NAME="ptplot description (short)"><B>1.1 What Is Ptplot?</B></A>
<DD> Ptplot is a Java 2-D graphing component.  Ptplot can be used
in applets and applications.  The
<A HREF="../../index.html">top-level Ptplot page</A> describes Ptplot
further.

<DT> <A NAME="ptplot pronounciation"><B>1.2 How do I pronounce 'ptplot'?</B>
<DD> pee-tee-plot.  Unlike with Ptolemy, the initial p in the pt is pronounced.

<DT> <A NAME="ptplot copyright"><B>1.3 What is the copyright?</B></A>
<DD> Ptplot is released under the fairly liberal UC Berkeley copyright.
Most files have the copyright at the top, for example, see
<A HREF="../../Plot.java"><CODE>Plot.java</CODE></A>

<DT> <A NAME="contact"><B>1.4 How do I contact the authors?</B></A>
<DD> The primary author of Ptplot is Professor Edward A. Lee.
Christopher Hylands is a coauthor.  William Wu contributed code.
You can contact the authors via
<A HREF="mailto:ptplot@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>ptplot@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>

<DT> <A NAME="mailing list"><B>1.5 Is there a mailing list?</B></A>
<DD> We maintain the <CODE>ptplot-announce</CODE> alias for announcing
new ptplot releases.  This alias is for Ptplot announcements only.  Thus,
you cannot post to this group.  To subscribe to this group,
send email to <A HREF="mailto:ptplot-announce-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>ptplot-announce-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>
with the word <CODE>subscribe</CODE> in the body, not the header.

<DT> <A NAME="downloading Ptplot"><B>2.1 How do I download Ptplot?</B></A>
<DD> <A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot/index.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot.html</CODE></A> has links
to the tar and zip files.

<DT> <A NAME="platforms that Ptplot runs under"><B>2.2 What platforms does Ptplot run under?</B></A>
<DD> Ptplot was develop under JDK1.1.4.  The only part of Ptplot
that requires JDK1.1 is the printing method in the Pxgraph class and
the Message class, which is used by the Pxgraph class for the 'About' window.
The rest of the code should compile under JDK1.0.2.  The code contains
comments that indicate the various 1.0.2/1.1 compatibility issues.
 <br> Everything else compiles under JDK1.0.2.  The ptplot.zip file we
supply was built with JDK1.0.2.  We chose to do this so that we could
support Netscape3.x.  The next release might only support JDK1.1 and
later. 

<DT> <A NAME="ptplot installation, what do I need"><B>2.3 What do I need to Install Ptplot?</B></A>
<DD> 
To use Ptplot, you will need the Java Development kit (JDK), which
can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com"><CODE>http://www.javasoft.com</CODE></A>.
The <A HREF="../codeDoc/ptplot.Pxgraph.html#Installation Instructions">Pxgraph documentation</A> contains further installation instructions.
 <P>You can also run Ptplot as an applet in your local browser.


<DT> <A NAME="ptplot troubleshooting overview"><B>2.4 Troubleshooting</B></A>
<DD> The <A HREF="troubleshooting.html">Ptplot Troubleshooting</A> guide
has a few hints.

 <P>You might find useful information on the Ptplot homepage at
<A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptplot</CODE></A>.

 <P>If you are really stumped, you can send mail to <A
HREF="mailto:cxh@eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>cxh@eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>.
Your mail should include:
<OL>
<LI> What version of Ptplot you are running.
<LI> What platform you are running under (Solaris, Windows etc.)
<LI> Exactly how to reproduce the bug.
</OL>
<DT> <A NAME="ptplot bug list"><B>2.5 Is there a bug list?</B></A>
<DD> Most of the known bugs are listed at the top of the
<A HREF="../../Plot.java"><CODE>Plot.java</CODE></A> file.

<H2><A NAME="ptplot faq: How do I  . . .">3. How do I  . . .</A>
</H2>

<DL>
<DT> <A NAME="mydata"><B>3.1 How do I plot my own data?</B></A>
<DD>
There are several ways to plot data using ptplot.

 <P>One is to create a datafile that consists of datasets and x,y pairs
See:
<A HREF="../../demo/bargraph.plt"><CODE>demo/bargraph.plt</CODE></A>

 <P>Binary data files are also supported, see
<A HREF="#binarydata"><B>3.2 How do I plot binary data?</B></A>

 <P>Another ways it to call <CODE>plot().addPoint</CODE>.
The <A HREF="../../demo/FourierSeries.html">Fourier Series demo</A>
uses this method.

The PlotFourierSeries class at
<A HREF="../../demo/PlotFourierSeries.java"><CODE>demo/PlotFourierSeries.java</CODE></A> is what actually does the plotting.

 <P> You can also plot data dynamically by creating a class that has a
<CODE>addPoints()</CODE> method which gets called by the PlotLive class.

The 
<A HREF="../../demo/Live.html"><CODE>demo/Live.html</CODE></A> demo
illustrates live plotting.
The PlotLiveDemo class at
<A HREF="../../demo/PlotLiveDemo.java"><CODE>demo/PlotLiveDemo.java</CODE></A>
is what actually does the plotting.

<DT> <A NAME="binarydata"><B>3.2 How do I plot binary data?</B></A>
<DD>Ptplot can plot binary datafiles.  
Ptplot 1.1 and earlier can plot data in the format that
was originally created by Joe Buck for the X11 <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> program.
For details on the format.  Ptplot 1.2 and later can also
plot data that consists of raw 4 byte floats.
For more information, see the description of the 
<CODE>-binary</CODE> option in
<A HREF="../../Pxgraph.java"><CODE>Pxgraph.java</CODE></A>.  You might
find the 
<A HREF="../codeDoc/ptplot.Pxgraph.html#-binary flag">javadoc Pxgraph documentation</A>
easier to read.

<DT>  <A NAME="appletprinting"><B>3.3 How do I print an plot from a Plot applet?</B></A>
<DD> Unfortunately, most browsers cannot print applets.  There are
work arounds, but in general, it is hard, and involves security
violations.

<A HREF="http://www.best.com/~pvdl/javafaq.html"><CODE>http://www.best.com/~pvdl/javafaq.html</CODE></A> says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4.1.11 How do I print a page with an applet?  

 <P>A. Browsers are starting to introduce support for this. Until they all
have it, your best bet is to print a screendump.  Using the browser to
print the page may leave a blank where the applet is.  Putting print
support in the applet will print the applet only, not the rest of the
browser page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For more information about printing, join the JavaSoft Developer
Connection (it is free) and search for printing.

 <P>Note that printing is supported from standalone Pxgraph applications in
the Pxgraph class.  Note that printing in the Pxgraph class requires
JDK1.1 and later.
