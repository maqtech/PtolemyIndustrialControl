<H2>The changes between ptplot1.2p1 and ptplot1.3</H2>
<MENU>
<LI> The Pxgraph class and the <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>scrip now take
two new command line arguments:
<DL>
<dt><code>-o</code> <code><i>output filename</i></code> 
<dd>The name of the file to place the print output in.  Currently
defaults to <code>/tmp/t.ps<code>.
<dt><code>-print</code>
<dd>Bring up the print dialog immeadiately upon startup.  Unfortunately,
there is no way to automatically print in JDK1.1, the user must hit
the <code>Ok</code> button.
</DL>
The new command line arguments are used to make it easier to create
PostScript output.

<LI> <A HREF="../../ptplot2mif.tcl"><CODE>ptplot2mif.tcl</CODE></A> script
can be used to convert the PostScript output of Ptplot to Framemaker
MIF format.  This script requires Tcl, and probably won't work under
Windows.  This script does not do a perfect job converting, but it is
a start.

<LI> URLS with <CODE>&amp;</CODE> characters in them were being parsed
incorrectly.

<li> A new jar file called <CODE>ptplotapplet.jar</CODE> is now
created.  This jar file is similar to <CODE>ptplot.jar</CODE>,
except it does not include the classes used by the Pxgraph class.
As a result, <CODE>ptplotapplet.jar</CODE> is smaller than
<CODE>ptplot.jar</CODE>.  The Pxgraph and Message classes are not
used in applets, so there is no need to download them for
applet only usage.

This bug was reported by Marion Schroeder &lt;schroeder@hmi.de&gt;.
</MENU>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.2 and ptplot1.2p1</H2>
Ptplot1.2p1 is a bug fix release. 
<MENU>
<LI> Ptplot1.1 was able able to parse scientific notation numbers such
as <CODE>1.0E-12</CODE>, but Ptplot1.2 could not.  
The change that caused the bug was that in Ptplot1.2, we used
<CODE>java.io.StreamTokenizer</CODE> to parse the
numbers.  Unfortunately, StreamTokenizer is buggy, it fails to parse
scientific notation.  For more information, see
<A HREF="http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4079180.html"><CODE>http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4079180.html</CODE></A>.
The fix was to adapt the Ptplot1.1 number parsing code to handle error bars.

</MENU>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.1 and ptplot1.2</H2>
<MENU>
<LI> Added support for JAR files.

<LI> Added <A HREF="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Ptplot</A>
and <A HREF="ptplotfaq.html">Ptplot FAQ</A>.


<LI> Added a demo that illustrates a
<A HREF="../../demo/Ptplot.html">JavaScript Interface to Ptplot</A>.

<LI> If <CODE>setXRange()</CODE> or <CODE>setYRange()</CODE> are not
explicitly called by the user, then the data is padded slightly so that
the data is not plotted on the axes.  The
<A HREF="../../demo/Marks.html">Black and white plot using unique marks</A>
demo is padded.  Many of the other demos are not padded because the X
and Y ranges are explicitly set either in the data file or in the Java
code that created the plot.


<LI> Raw binary files that consist only of 4 byte floats are now supported.
Formerly, ptplot only supported Joe Buck's binary format, which used
single characters as plot directives (see the
<A HREF="../codeDoc/ptplot.Pxgraph.html#-binary flag">javadoc Pxgraph documentation</A> 
for details about this format).  The new raw binary format
now reads the first byte, and if it is not a <CODE>d</CODE>, then
the raw 4 byte float format is assumed.
 <P>This format was prompted by a request from 
John O'Sullivan&lt;John.OSullivan@analog.com&gt;.
The <CODE>demo/data/bin.plt</CODE> was converted to the new raw 4 byte float
format.

<LI> Error bars are now generated.  If the data file contains a line that
consists of four numbers, then the first two numbers are assumed to be the
x and y values, and the last two numbers are assumed to be the lower and upper
y values for the error bar.  The numbers can be separated by white space
or a comma.  See the <A HREF="../../demo/ErrorBars.html">Error Bars</A> demo
for more information.
 <br>The error bar code is based on a code fragment from
Michael Altmann &lt;michael@email.labmed.umn.edu&gt;.

<LI> Ptplot now supports logarithmic axes, which are
controlled by the file directives: <CODE>XLog: on</CODE> and
<CODE>YLog: on</CODE>.  The <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> script
now takes <CODE>-lnx</CODE> and <CODE>-lny</CODE> arguments as well.
See the <A HREF="../../demo/LogAxes.html">Log Axes</A> demo for more information. 

<LI> Fixed problem with recycling colors and marks.
The bug was reported by Lutz Harnisch, &lt;Lutz.Harnisch@hmrag.com&gt;

</MENU>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.0 and ptplot1.1</H2>
<MENU>
<LI> In 1.1, PlotBox extends Panel.  In 1.0 PlotBox extended Applet.
This makes it much easier to use Plot as an component in either an
application or an applet that contains other components.
<LI> The PlotApplet class is new in 1.1.  PlotApplet can be used 
for applets that use the Plot class, or the PlotLive class.
As a result, the html applet tags for the demos now use
<CODE>code="ptplot.PlotApplet"</CODE>.
Formerly, they used 
<CODE>code="ptplot.Plot"</CODE>
<LI> The directory structure has been reorganized so that
the plot classes are in ptplot, and the demo classes are in
<A HREF="../../demo"><CODE>ptplot/demo</CODE></A>.
This means that the ptplot.zip does not contain the demo
classes, which is better if anyone actually wants to _use_ the plotter
instead of just running the demos.
<LI> There is a <A HREF="../../demo/audio/PlayingWave.html">Playing Wave
Applet</A> that uses real time audio.
<LI> Edward Lee fixed a bar graph label bug reported by Marc Ellis.
<LI> A few other minor bugs were fixed.
