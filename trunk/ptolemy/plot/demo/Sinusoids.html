<h1>Plot data generated in Java</h1>
<hr>
The plot below demonstrates the use of Java code to compute the data to be plotted
on the fly:
<p>
<applet code="PlotDemo.class" width=400 height=200>
</applet>
<p>
Note that you can zoom in on any region of the graph by drawing a box.
The <a href="PlotDemo.java">source code</a> defines a class <code>PlotDemo</code>
derived from <code>Plot</code>.  This new class contains a sequence of Java
statements in its <code>init()</code> method that configures and constructs
the plot.  This particular example also demonstrates a number of features.
In particular, no marks are made at all for each plotted point, so the plot
consists entirely of connected lines.
The X and Y ranges are given explicitly, but note that the Y (vertical) range
is insufficient to contain all the points.  The lines are clipped at the boundary
of the range.
Clicking on the "fill" button at the upper right brings all data within range.
Note further that the Y axis is labeled with explicitly given tick marks,
this time placed at non-integer positions, and again given string labels.
Notice also that the "impulses" feature is turned on, causing a line to drawn
from each plotted point down to the x axis.
