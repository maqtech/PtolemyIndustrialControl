<h1>Live, Animated Plot</h1>
<hr>
The following plot illustrates a dynamically updated plot:
<p>
<applet name="Live" code="plot.PlotLiveDemo" width=400 height=400
    codebase="../.."
    archive="plot/plot.zip"
    alt="If you had a java-enabled browser, you would see an applet here."
>
   <hr>If your browser recognized the applet tag,
    you would see an applet here.<hr>
</applet>
<p>
Click on the start button to start the plotting, and on the stop button to stop it.
Such a plot is created by defining a class derived from <code>PlotLive</code>
(which is abstract).  The example shown here is the
<a href="../PlotLiveDemo.java">PlotLiveDemo</a> class.
It defines only two methods, <code>init()</code> and <code>run()</code>.
The first of these sets static properties of the plot (title, labels, etc.)
while the second defines the body of a thread that generates points forever (if it is
allowed to).
<p>
There are still some problems with <code>PlotLive</code>.
The most annoying is that this class uses the "exclusive or" drawing mode to allow
it to easily erase old points as it adds new ones.  This mode, however, introduces
a number of annoying artifacts in the graph.  In particular, if marks are
made at the plotted points, and lines are drawn between points, the lines
effectively erase the marks where they intersect.
Moreover, if lines or points overlap, they erase each other.
Surely there must be a better way to achieve easy erasure of drawn graphics.
