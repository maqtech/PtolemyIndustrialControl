An example of a bar graph:
<p>
<applet code="Plot.class" width=500 height=400>
<param name="dataurl" value="bargraph.plt">

<p>
Here,  data is read from a <a href=bargraph.plt>URL</a>.
The horizontal axis is manually labeled with tick marks indicating years.
It is possible to control the thickness of bars and the offset of the bars
behind by editing that file.
