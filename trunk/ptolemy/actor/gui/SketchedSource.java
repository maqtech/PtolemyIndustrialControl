/** This actor produces as its output a signal that has been sketched by the
 *  user on the screen.  The <i>length</i> parameter specifies the
 *  number of samples in the sketched signal.  The <i>period</i>
 *  parameter, if greater than zero, specifies the period with which
 *  the signal should be repeated (in samples).  If the period is longer
 *  than the length, then zeros will be inserted. If the period is less
 *  than the length, then the last few values will not be used.
 *  If this parameter is zero or
 *  negative, then the sketched signal is produced exactly once,
 *  at the beginning of the execution of the model.  If the period
 *  is greater than zero, and the sketch is modified during execution
 *  of the model, then the modification appears in the next cycle of
 *  the period after the modification has been completed.  In other
 *  words, the change does not appear mid-cycle.
 *  <p>
 *  This actor can be used with its own plot widget, which is the
 *  default behavior, or more interestingly, it can share a plot
 *  widget with another plot object.  This way, the sketch can be
 *  be made right on a plot that also displays the results of
 *  processing the sketched signal.
 *  <p>
 *  When this actor has its own plot widget, you can specify where that
 *  widget appears by calling place().  If you do not, then the
 *  plot widget will be created in its own window.  You can also
 *  call place() with an argument that is an instance of EditablePlot.
 *  This is how you create a shared plot.  That same instance of
 *  EditablePlot can be used by another actor, such as SequencePlotter,
 *  to display data.  Be sure to set the <i>dataset</i> parameter
 *  of this actor or the <i>dataset</i> parameter of the
 *  other actor so that they do not use the same dataset numbers.
