//// Receiver
/**
Interface for objects that can hold tokens. An implementation of this
interface has two key methods: put and get. Put deposits a token into the
receiver. Get retrieves a token that has been put. The order of
the retrieved tokens depends on specific implementations, and does not
necessarily match the order in which tokens have been put.
<p>
All implementations of this interface must follow these rules, regardless
of the number of threads that are accessing the receiver:
<ul>
<li> If hasToken() returns true then calling get() should not result in a
NoTokenException being thrown.
<li> If hasRoom() returns true then calling put() should not result in a
NoRoomException being thrown.
</ul>
In general, this means that threaded domains will provide a higher level of
synchronization for receivers.
<p>
Objects that implement this interface can only be contained
by an instance of IOPort.
