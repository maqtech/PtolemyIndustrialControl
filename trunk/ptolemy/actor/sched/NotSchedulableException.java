This is a special case of the InvalidStateException such that a
CompositeActor is not schedulable by a certain scheduler.
This class has the same constructors as its supper class, but it also
has an Enumeration that contains the unschedulable
actors in the CompositeActor. The enumeration can be used by other
algorithms to do further scheduling, or by the UI to present to the users.
