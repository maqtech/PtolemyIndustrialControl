//// Scheduler
/**
The base class for schedulers. A scheduler schedules the execution order
of the containees of a CompositeActor.
<p>
A scheduler has a reference to a StaticSchedulingDirector, and
provides the schedule.
The director will use this schedule to govern the execution of a
CompositeActor.
<p>
The schedule sequence, once constructed, is cached and reused in the
next time if the schedule is still valid. The validation of a schedule
is set by the <code>setValid()</code> method. If the current schedule
is set to be not valid, the schedule() method will call the protected
_schedule() method to reconstruct it. _schedule() is the place the
scheduling algorithm goes, and the derived class should override it.
<p>
Scheduler implements the TopologyListener interface, and register itself
as a TopologyListener to the host director.  When a topology change occurs,
the director will inform all the listeners (including the
scheduler), and the scheduler will invalidate the current schedule.

FIXME: This class uses LinkedList in the collections package. Change it
to Java collection when update to JDK1.2
