//// FunctionDependency

/** A FunctionDependency is an abstract class that describes the 
    function dependency that output ports of an associated actor
    have on its input ports.  The associated actor is specified by
    the constructor argument and cannot be changed once this object
    is constructed.
    <p>
    An output port has a function dependency on an input port if
    in its fire method, it sends tokens on the output port that
    depend on tokens gotten from the input port.
    <p> 
    This class uses a graph to describe the function dependency,
    where the nodes of the graph correspond to the ports and an edge
    indicates a function dependency. The edges go from input ports
    to output ports that depend on them.
    <p>
    The dependency graph by default indicates complete dependency,
    which means that each output port depends on all input ports.
    This default dependency graph is constructed in the protected
    method {@link #_constructDependencyGraph()}, which can be
    overridden in subclasses to construct a more accurate 
    dependency graph. See {@link FunctionDependencyOfAtomicActor}
    and {@link FunctionDependencyOfCompositeActor} for example
    concrete subclasses. The composite actor version analyzes
    the contained model to determine from the function dependencies
    of the contained actors and from the connections what the
    function dependencies of the composite actor are.
