//// TypedAtomicActor
/**
A TypedAtomicActor is an AtomicActor whose ports and parameters have types.
The container is required to be an instance of TypedCompositeActor.
Derived classes may further constrain the container by overriding
setContainer(). The Ports of TypedAtomicActors are constrained to be
TypedIOPorts.  Derived classes may further constrain the ports by
overriding the public method newPort() to create a port of the
appropriate subclass, and the protected method _addPort() to throw an
exception if its argument is a port that is not of the appropriate
subclass.
<p>
The typeConstraintList() method returns the type constraints among
the contained ports.  This base class provides a default implementation
of this method, which should be suitable for most of the derived classes.
