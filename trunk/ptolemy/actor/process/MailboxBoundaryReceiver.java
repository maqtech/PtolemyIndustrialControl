//// MailboxBoundaryReceiver
/**
A process receiver that stores tokens via a mailbox and can be used by
composite actors. This receiver extends the functionality of the mailbox
receiver found in the actor package in two key ways. First it facilitates
blocking reads and writes. If a read (a call to get()) is attempted when
this mailbox is empty then the call will block until a token is placed in
the mailbox. Similarly if a write (a call to put()) is attempted when
this mailbox is full (has a token) then the call will block until the
token is removed from the mailbox.
<P>
The second key feature of this mailbox receiver is that it can be used
by opaque composite actors operating in process-oriented models of
computation. Indeed the name "MailboxBoundaryReceiver" is used to
indicate that this receiver can be contained on the boundary of an
opaque composite actor. The get() and put() methods of mailbox boundary
receiver can be invoked by a Branch object. In such cases any blocks that
occur are registered with the calling branch. The branch will then serve
as a proxy by communicating to the director through the branch controller.
<P>
Note that it is not necessary for a mailbox boundary receiver to be used
in the ports of an opaque composite actor. It is perfectly fine for a
mailbox boundary receiver to be used in the ports of an atomic actor. In
such cases the get() and put() methods are called without the use of a
branch object. If blocking reads or writes occur they are registered with
the controlling director without the need for a branch or branch
controller.
