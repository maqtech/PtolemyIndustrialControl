/**
A Branch serves as a proxy for a BranchController by transfer tokens
between the producer receiver and the consumer receiver to which it
is assigned. The execution of a Branch is controlled by a 
BranchController in that a BranchController can deny a Branch permission 
to get or put data in the receiver. 

An iteration of a Branch lasts until the BranchController notifies
the Branch that the current iteration is done. Such notification 
occurs via a TerminateBranchException that is thrown as soon as a
Branch determines that isIterationOver() returns true. Until an
iteration is over, a Branch will indefinitely attempt to get and
put data to the receivers it controls. This may result in the
Branch blocking on a read or write, only to be awakened by a
TerminateBranchException.

Once an iteration has ended, a Branch will immediately begin a new
iteration unless isActive() returns false. The method isActive()
will return true for the duration of the Branch's life. If 
isActive() returns false, then isIterationOver() will return true.
Once isActive() returns false, then the Branch will die, as will
the thread (BranchThread) controlling the Branch, and the Branch
reference should be set to null.
