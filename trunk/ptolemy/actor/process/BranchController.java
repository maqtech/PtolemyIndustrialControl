//// BranchController
/**
A BranchController manages the execution of a set of Branches. The
BranchController monitors whether the branches have deadlocked and
whether the iteration of branch executions is over. 

An iteration lasts until no branches are allowed additional communication.
Based on the BranchController parameters, it is possible that the
Branches will be allowed indefinite communication implying that 
iterations will continue into perpetuity. 

If all branches are deadlocked and the iteration is not over, the 
controller will notify its director by calling the director's 
_branchBlocked() method.

The BranchController's method isActive() will return true for the 
duration of the BranchController's life. If isActive() returns false, 
then isIterationOver() will return true.
Once isActive() returns false, then the BranchController will die, 
as will all Branches that it controls, and the BranchController 
reference should be set to null.

There are several methods of this class that reveal internal state. 
The names of these methods all begin with the verb "is" or "are" 
and have boolean return types. These state methods are organized in 
a partial ordering. A method is considered
to be "subordinate" with respect to a "dominant" method if the return value
of the subordinate method is directly impacted by the return value of the
dominant method. All state methods methods are subordinate to isActive().
