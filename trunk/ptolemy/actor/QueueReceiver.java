//// QueueReceiver
/**
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue with optional capacity and
history. Objects are appended to the queue with the put() method,
and removed from the queue with the take() method. The object
removed is the oldest one in the queue. By default, the capacity is
unbounded, but it can be set to any nonnegative size. If the history
capacity is greater than zero (or infinite, indicated by a capacity
of -1), then objects removed from the queue are transferred to a
second queue rather than simply deleted. By default, the history
capacity is zero.
