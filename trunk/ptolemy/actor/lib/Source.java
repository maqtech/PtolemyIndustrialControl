/**
Base class for simple data sources.  This class provides an output port
and a trigger input port, both exposed as public variables.  The trigger
port is a multiport with undeclared type, meaning that you can supply it
with any data type.  The trigger port can also be left unconnected.
The purpose of the trigger input is to (optionally) supply events that
cause the actor to fire.  For some domains, such as SDF and CT, this is
entirely unnecessary, as the actor will fire whether inputs are supplied
or not.  In such domains, the trigger input will normally be left unconnected.
In this base class, the fire() method reads
at most one token from each channel of the trigger input, if any,
and then discards the token.
<p>
Some derived classes may attach additional significance to an input
on the trigger port. For example, they might fix the type and attach
some significance to the value.  Note that it is not recommend to
use getWidth() on the port to determine whether the port is connected,
since the width may be greater than zero even if there
is no actual source of data.  This can occur, for example, if a trigger port
is connected to the inside of a port of an opaque composite actor, and
there is nothing connected to the outside of that port. It is not
recommended to make the behavior of an actor dependent on a global
property such as whether there is ultimately a source of data.
