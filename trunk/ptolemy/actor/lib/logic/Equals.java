/**

A polymorphic logical equals operator.  This operator has two
input ports and one output port, none of which are multiports.  The
types on the ports are undeclared and will be resolved by the type
resolution mechanism. A datum that arrives on the input port named
<i>upperPort</i> will be compared for equality with a datum in the
input port named <i>lowerPort</i>.  This distinction between operands
is necessary to determine which method to call; data in the
<i>upperPort</i> is comparable to being on the left side of the
equality operator.
<p>
Currently, the type system is quite liberal about the resolved
types it will permit at the inputs.
It consumes at most one input token from each port.
If no input tokens are available at all, then no output is produced.
