//// DatagramReceiver
/**
This actor receives datagram packets via a separate thread it creates.
Datagrams are open-loop internet communications.  Each contains data
plus a kind of return address.  FIXME - return address output has not
been implemented.  Datagrams use the UDP protocol under
which no reply or confirmation is expected.  This is in contrast to
TCP which expects confirmations and attempts to receive packets in
order.  Because UDP makes no such attempts, it never hangs and does
not need to be timed out.  The simplest scenario has the thread
constantly stalled awaiting a packet.  When it receives one, it
quickly queues it, calls fireAt(), and then stalls again for the next
packet.  The director is then expected to respond to fireAt() by
calling the actor's fire() method.  Fire() broadcasts the data
received, plus the remote address and remote socket number from which
the datagram originated.  This information goes to connected actors in
the Ptolemy model in the manner prescribed by the director.  <p>

This actor has been developed to work in the Discrete Event (DE) and
Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) domains.  Use elsewhere with caution.

The data portion of the packet is brodcast as an array of bytes.  The
remote address and socket number are each broadcast as an int.
FIXME-Eventually do work below, but for now I have made actor
switchable with <i>decodeWithPtolemyParser</i> boolean parameter.
FIXME-Add auxilary actors to translate in and out of these raw
formats. Specifically, for the byte array: serialize, deserialize,
packInt, unpackInt, packDouble, unpackDouble, packString, unpackString
(or maybe one actor or actor pair which handles several data types),
packForParse, unpackUsingParse.  Specifically for the address:
IPIntToString, IPStringToInt (takes only "128.32.239.10" format or
"localhost" to ensure no lookup delay), URLLookupToString.  (Maybe
also something working from/to a "128.32.239.10:80" format.  Maybe a
long combining both IP address and remote socket number.)  Additional
planned work: Ability to handle "connect"ions (which speed datagram
communication by only having to pass security once).  A similar actor
for HTTP and a generic one which can receive any kind of packet,
perhaps over a range of local socket numbers.  A simplified form of
this actor without a separate thread for experimenting with using
model composition (e.g. PN enclosing DE) for providing necessary
concurrency.  <p>

The actor's behavior under less simple scenarios is governed by
parameters.  Additional packet(s) can arrive while the director is
getting around to calling fire().  Conversely, the director may make
extra calls to fire(), even before any datagrams have come in.  (It is
assumed, however, that for each call to the director's fireAt()
method, the director will make at least one call to the actor's fire()
method.)  <p>

There are two packet buffers.  The thread and the fire() method
contain synchronized sections.  This synchronization prevent conflicts
when accessing the shared buffers and when accessing the count of
queued packets.  <p>

The <i>overwrite</i>parameter applies to the eager packet scenario.
If true (the default), it has the actor discard the queued
packet in favor of the new one.  If false, the new packet is queued
behind the existing one.  In the latter case, both buffers are now
full.  The thread then waits for fire() to consume a queued packet
before it stalls again awaiting the next.  In all other cases
(<i>overwrite</i> true or no queued packets) the thread immidiately
stalls to await the next packet.<p>

FIXME - Implement the <i>repeat</i> parameter as described below.  The
<i>repeat</i> parameter applies to the eager director case.  If
<i>repeat</i> is true, additional calls to fire() cause rebroadcast of
the most recent data and return-address information.  When fire() is
called before the first packet has arrived, default data are
broadcast.  If <i>repeat</i> is false, then the the default data are
always used for additional calls to fire(), even a previous packet
is available to repeat.  Until implemented, <i>repeat</i> is false.<p>

The <i>blockAwaitingDatagram</i> parameter interects with the
<i>defaultOutput</i> and <i>repeat</i> above.  If true, the actor's
fire method blocks until a datagram has arrived.  If false, the
default/repeat behavior described above takes effect.

This actor has a parameter <i>localSocketNumber</i> for the port
number assigned to the local datagram socket.  Initially, the local
socket number is set to -1 to indicate no socket at all (leave
socket=null).  FIXME - This "-1" business is no good if the actor were
within a composite actor that was itself within the library.
Currently, this actor allocates the socket in preinitialize().  It
needs to do it before the model runs but after it leaves the library.
This may require a redifinition of when the [pre]initialize() methods
get called.  <p>

Here's a very useful command for use when working with this actor.
Bash command netstat -an is very useful in seeing current port allocations!
