/**
Produce an output token on each firing with a value that is
equal to a scaled version of the input.  The actor is polymorphic
in that it can support any token type that supports multiplication
by the <i>factor</i> parameter.  The output type is constrained to be at least
as general as both the input and the <i>factor</i> parameter.
For data types where multiplication is not commutative (such
as matrices), the parameter is multiplied on the left, and the input
on the right.
