An interface between Java Native Interface (JNI) classes and Ptolemy.

<p>Under Windows, JNI does not work with recent versions of Cygwin
and GCC after gcc3.2.x.  The workaround is to install the version of Cygwin
that shipped with Ptolemy II 4.0, see
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII4.0/cygwin.htm">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII4.0/cygwin.htm</a>


<p>The Interface to C actors using the Java Native Interface is not
available via the Windows Installer (or Web Start). To use the
JNI/Ptolemy II interface, you must download Ptolemy II as source files
and compile.

<p>The JNI user interface does not permit creation of new JNI actors.


<p>To build under windows, you may need to edit <code>jni.h</code>,
see
<a href="JNIUtilities.html">JNIUtilities.java</a>.

<p>Under Windows, you may need to create 
<code>/usr/bin/gmake</code>:
<pre>
cp /usr/bin/make /usr/bin/gmake
</pre>

<p> A demo can be found in 
<code>$PTII/jni/demo/jni</code>
See the <code>README.html</code> file in that directory.

<p>If you follow the instructions in
<a href="JNIUtilities.html">JNIUtilities.java</a> , then eventually you
will get a NameDuplicationException.

<p>The resulting model will be missing

<pre>
&lt;property name="output" class="jni.Argument"
value="false,false,true,double"&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

In the short term, one workaround is to edit the xml file directly and
add the appropriate property by hand.

<p> JNI will not work with Hierarchical classes, subclasses, and inner
classes
