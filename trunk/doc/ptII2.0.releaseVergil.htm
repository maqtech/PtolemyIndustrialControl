<h2>Limitations</h2>
Version 2.0 has a number of limitations.

<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<menu>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from 
ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.

<li> The Ptolemy II 2.0-beta release does not include the design
document.  We will include an updated version of the design document
in the full release.  The Ptolemy II 1.0 design document can be found
in:

<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/designdoc.htm#in_browser">Ptolemy Web Site</a>

<li> The Using Vergil html file has some bogus characters in it.

<li> <code>vergil foo</code> hangs.  No window comes up if foo does not exist.

<li> The documentation for custom actors used in demonstrations is not
included in the release.

<li> Dragging the UnitConversion icon into a blank canvas will
throw an exception because UnitConversion requires data
in the other Unit icons.

</menu>



<li> Applet issues:
	<menu>
	<li>   Look inside on a composite actor fails :
	"Cannot look inside with a configuration"
	<li> Applets that use MoMLViewerApplet do not auto start.
	These applets include
		<ul>
		<li> Giotto applets
		<li> SDF Expression, FixPoint, LMSAdaptive, MaximumEntropy
		</ul>


	<li> SDF Spectrum plot is not filled at the end
	<li> $PTII/doc/expression.htm needs to be updated

<li> The DDE Zeno demo produces an error message in the Java Plug-in console
window:
<pre>
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: LowerJoin - Attempt to set current time to the past; time = 50.001. The _lastTime was 54.0

</pre>

<li> Running the Networked demo via an applet on the local
file system results in an AccessControlException.
<pre>
com.microstar.xml.XmlException: XML element "entity" triggers exception:
  java.lang.Exception: Attempted to lookup 'Waveform', but got: 
  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Waveform
Attempted to find as a moml class, but got: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.net.SocketPermission ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu resolve) in file:/C:/Program Files/Ptolemy/Ptolemy II 2.0 beta2/ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/ at line 62 and column 118

</pre>

The Network demo does not work as a local applet because the xml file
includes a reference to http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu, which is
not on the local file system, so we get a SecurityException.

	</menu>

<li> Web Start issues:
	<menu>
	<li> Applet generation still does not work in the Web Edition
	<li> Invoking a pdf file or the code generator brings up a blank
	 window.
	<li> Web Start is limited to about 65Mb of memory
	 <br>If you try to run all the demos, then eventually you may
	see the following in the Web Start console
<pre>
761 ms. Memory: 65280K Free: 3614K (6%)
7471 ms. Memory: 65280K Free: 931K (1%)
Exception occurred during event dispatching:
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

	&lt;&lt;no stack trace available&gt;&gt;
</pre>
	</menu>
</menu>

<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<menu>
<li>The actor library is far from complete.
<li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
expressions of double-valued inputs.

<li> The Ptolemy parameter parser uses comma "," to separate elements
in an array.  This causes problems when Ptolemy is run on
European machines that use a comma "1,0" instead of a period "1.1"
in floating point numbers.

<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

<!-- If you change the next paragraph update install.htm -->
<li>The Matlab interface works only under Windows and it requires that
Matlab be installed on the local machine.  The Matlab interface has
been tested with Matlab 6.1, which corresponds with R12.1.

<li> The actor.lib.comm.SerialComm actor requires that Javacomm is installed

<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html#in_browser"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html</CODE></a>.  The SerialComm actor
will only work under Windows.

</menu>

<h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.


<h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>

Below are some of the limitations of Vergil, the Ptolemy II Graphical
User Interface.

<menu>
<li> You should not change the names of built in ports - The port
mechanism should disallow port name changes on ports that are
named in Java.  The UI could recognize this.  The UI should
not allow the user to remove built in Java defined ports.
<li> Query needs to be put into a scroll pane

<li> Manually setting of the types of actors like ArrayToSequence that
have constraints on their element types can cause problems.

<li> HTVQ demo is badly laid out when run under vergil
	
<li> The Vergil HTML Viewer does not correctly handle internal hyperlinks.
The codegen page is especially difficult to use because of this.

<li>No undo mechanism.
<li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
<li>It is difficult to control wire routing.
<li>Cannot have more than one vertex in a connection.
<li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.
<li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
<li>Icon editor not yet integrated.
<li>Debugger not yet integrated.
<li>It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.
<li>No dynamic class reloading.

<a href="codegen.htm#limitations">Code Generation</a> page. 

</menu>

<h3>Missing Domains</h3>
