<!--vergilDocs-->
<h2>Limitations</h2>
Version 2.0 has a number of limitations.

<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<menu>

<li> Code generation does not work in the Ptolemy 2.0 Web Edition.
The problem is that some of the code generation facility requires
that the <CODE>PTII</CODE> environment variable be set.

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from 
ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.
</menu>


<li> Webstart issues:
	<menu>
	<li> applet generation still does not work in the Web Edition
	</menu>


<li> JDK1.4 issues:
	<menu>
		<pre>


	(3/27/02)

        <li>JDK1.4: Ball demo does not display any graphics?
	In fact, none of the GR demos displayed graphics for me under
	Web Start

	</menu>

<li> Other bugs:
	<menu>

	<li> Potential bug with Unit systems because Unit systems
	are global not local.

	</menu>



<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<menu>
<li>The actor library is far from complete.
<li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
expressions of double-valued inputs.

<li> The Ptolemy parameter parser uses comma "," to separate elements
in an array.  This causes problems when Ptolemy is run on
European machines that use a comma "1,0" instead of a period "1.1"
in floating point numbers.

<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

<!-- If you change the next paragraph update install.htm -->
<li>The Matlab interface works only under Windows and it requires that
Matlab be installed on the local machine.  The Matlab interface has
been tested with Matlab 6.1, which corresponds with R12.1.

<li> The actor.lib.comm.SerialComm actor requires that Javacomm is installed
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html"><CODE>http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html</CODE></a>.  The SerialComm actor
will only work under Windows.

</menu>

<h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.


<h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>

Below are some of the limitations of Vergil, the Ptolemy II Graphical
User Interface.

<menu>
<li> You should not change the names of built in ports - The port
mechanism should disallow port name changes on ports that are
named in Java.  The UI could recognize this.  The UI should
not allow the user to remove built in Java defined ports.
	<li> Query needs to be put into a scroll pane

<li> Manually setting of the types of actors like ArrayToSequence that
have constraints on their element types can cause problems.
<li>No undo mechanism.
<li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
<li>It is difficult to control wire routing.
<li>Cannot have more than one vertex in a connection.
<li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.
<li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
<li>Icon editor not yet integrated.
<li>Debugger not yet integrated.
<li>It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.
<li>No dynamic class loading.
