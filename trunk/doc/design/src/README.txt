TOC
---
After generating the toc and idx, edit the idx and
move the first index entry for the UML symbol - to below the header.

Distiller
---------
Acrobat distiller has an option that by default "downsamples
images to 72 dpi."  This seems dumb.  Turning this off fixes
the printing problems with chapter 3, with no noticable increase
in file size.  See the file ~eal/TMP/design.pdf.  I've also checked
in some minor fixes in the domain chapters, and regenerated everything.
The pdf file in ~eal/TMP is the latest version.

BTW, in Distiller,
If you also turn off compression of images, the file size increases
from about 3.7M to about 8M.  So don't do that!

Figures
-------
Having the figures at the bottom of the page is right.
If you put them below the point where they are referred to,
Frame leaves orphaned lines below or above them.  The layout
ends up being far worse.
