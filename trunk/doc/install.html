<h1>Ptolemy II Installation</h1>
<h2>Rebuilding</h2>
The Ptolemy II distribution includes the compiled Java <CODE>.class</CODE>
files and the <CODE>javadoc</CODE> output, so it is not
necessary to 'build' or run <CODE>make</CODE> to use Ptolemy II
 <p>However, if you would like to rebuild from the Java sources, 
you should run <CODE>$PTII/configure</CODE>, which is a GNU autoconf script
that looks for your Java compiler, reads in <CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk.in</CODE> 
and generates <CODE>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk</CODE>.
