<h1>Ptolemy II version 0.3 Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II version 0.3 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>This release is meant for programmers already familiar with Java.

 <p>Ptolemy II 0.3 includes applet demonstrations of the domains, but
it does not include a GUI.

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy 0.3, it can be found

<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 0.3 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.2.

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 0.3 under Solaris 2.5.1 and NT4.0sp3 
with JDK1.1.6.

 <p>Ptolemy II can be built under JDK1.2, though we have not thoroughly
tested Ptolemy II under JDK1.2.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite 

<h2>Limitations</h2>
