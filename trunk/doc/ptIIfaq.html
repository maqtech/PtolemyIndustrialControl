<dd> Currently,Ptolemy II does not have a block diagram editor like
Ptolemy 0.x.  At this point, we are concentrating on the fundamentals
necessary to build Ptolemy II.  We are looking at using

for a GUI


<dt> <a href="#ptolemy0_x">Ptolemy 0.x Compatibility?</a>
<dd> 
Ptolemy II and Ptolemy 0.x are two very different software systems. 

Ptolemy 0.x is fairly mature software in that the design is stable and
mostly unchanging. The Ptolemy II software system is still in the
early stages of its life cycle, so the design is changing.


<menu>
<li> They are written in different languages (Java vs. C++)

<li> They have different file formats. Ptolemy 0.x uses Octtools,
Ptolemy II uses a system based on XML

<li> They have different user interfaces.
</menu>

However, all is not lost for Ptolemy 0.x users. We are considering various compatibility issues: 


<menu>

<li> Once the Ptolemy II User Interface is mostly complete, it may be
possible to modify it so that it can be used with Ptolemy 0.x.

<li> We may develop file translators to help convert icon images and
design layouts.

<li> It may be possible to develop wrappers that run Ptolemy 0.x
stars. This would be fairly tricky to do.
