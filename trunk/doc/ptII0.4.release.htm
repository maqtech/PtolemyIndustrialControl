<h1>Ptolemy II 0.4 Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II 0.4 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>Ptolemy II 0.4 includes applet demonstrations of the domains, but
it does not include a GUI.

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy 0.4, it can be found
in <a href="design/toc.htm" target="toc">$PTII/doc/design</a>.

The most recent copy of the Ptolemy II design document can be
found online at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html</CODE></a>


<h2>Major Features that are new in Ptolemy 0.4 </h2>
<menu>
<li> Ptolemy II 0.4 supports an XML language called
<a href="../ptolemy/moml/demo/">MoML</a> for specifying
component-based models. 
(Edward A. Lee, Steve Neuendorffer and the Ptolemy Team)

<li> The source code for the
<a href="../ptolemy/domains/fsm/demo">Finite State Machine (FSM)</a>
domain is included.
(Xiaojun Liu and the Ptolemy Team)

<li> Major rewrite of the type system.
(Yuhong Xiong)

<li> The Discrete Event domain has been tuned for performance.
(Edward A. Lee and the Ptolemy Team)

<li> We are moving away from the JDK1.1 collections package and using
the JDK1.2 collections classes from java.util.
Methods that shipped with Ptolemy II 0.3 that used the JDK 1.1
collections package have been marked as deprecated in Ptolemy II 0.4.
It is our intention to remove these deprecated methods in Ptolemy II 1.0
and to no longer ship the $PTII/collections directory.
(The Ptolemy Team)

<li> Support for fix point data types.,
(Bart Kienhuis, Yuhong Xiong)

<li> Various demonstrations have been added, removed and/or rewritten.
(The Ptolemy Team)
<li> Commmand line invocation of models via $PTOLEMY/bin/ptolemy.
(Edward A. Lee, Christopher Hylands and the Ptolemy Team)
</menu>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 0.4 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.2.

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 0.4 under Solaris 2.5.1 and NT4.0sp3 and later
with JDK1.2.2.  Ptolemy II 0.4 has also been built and tested
under JDK1.3 beta.

<p> Ptolemy II 0.4 will not compile under JDK1.1.x.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite 

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<menu>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from <a
href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu</CODE></a>.

<li> Ptolemy II 0.4 does not include a GUI.

<li> This is the first release of the Finite State Machine domain (FSM)
which has the following limitations
	<menu>
	<li> The FSM design document chapter is not part of the 0.4 beta
	<li> There are not very many tests for FSM
	<li> MoML support for FSM models is incomplete.
	</menu>


<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

<li> The import statement in MoML requires the base attribute.
The following will not work:
<pre>
&lt;import source="testClass2.xml"/&gt;
</pre>
Use the following instead
<pre>
&lt;import base="../../.." source="ptolemy/moml/test/testClass2.xml"/&gt;
</pre>
<li> The JDK1.2.1 Plug-in has a bug that causes the Netscape or Iexplorer
process to linger after exiting.  The workaround is to turn of the JIT
using the Java Plug-in Control Panel, see the <a href="troubleshooting.htm#jit">Troubleshooting guide</a> for details.
This bug may be fixed in JDK1.2.2.
