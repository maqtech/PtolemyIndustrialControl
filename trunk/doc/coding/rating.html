<h1>Change control and code rating overview</h1>

This document describes a simple change control process, designed to
improve management of change in small-ish development projects. The
process is based on formal reviews.

<a name="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>

Consider the following scenario.

<P> Frank, an enthusiastic software developer (aren't we all?), writes
a fabulous piece of foobar code.  He tests it, installs it in the
public repository, and then keeps working on other code that uses
foobar. A few weeks later, Ernest starts using Frank's foobar code,
and discovers that it has some design flaws that weren't apparent to
Frank. Ernest, in the spirit of fixing problems when they're found,
adds some code and moves some other code around to fix the flaws, and
keeps on working.

 <P> A few days later, Frank is suddenly very unhappy.  Firstly,
his build broke because of a couple of small changes Ernest made to
the types of a couple of methods. Easily fixed. Then he discovers that
he is going to have to rework a lot of his code because Ernest
redesigned part of the internal architecture of the foobar, which
showed up in the order of method calling and the way event callbacks
were handled. Eventually, the whole system is functioning again, but
not without some acrimonious email debate, code rework, and perhaps
some damage to the team dynamics.

 <P> How could this have been done better?  Ernest could have tried to
work around the flaw -- but ultimately that's a negative impact on
quality, and Ernest clearly felt that it was unacceptable. Or a change
control "committee" could be established to evaluate the impact and
cost/benefit of changes such as Ernest's. OK, but that's only half the
story -- the other half is that a peer review could have solved the
problem before it occurred. Firstly, Ernest (and others) could have
voiced their concern about the design flaw at a time when fixing it
would be relatively cheap. Either the flaw a) would have been fixed,
or b) it wouldn't have been fixed, but the reasons for not fixing it
would be documented and -- more importantly -- accepted by other
developers as a necessary decision in light of other constraints.

 <P> The rest of this page outlines a simple framework for combining
these two aspects: quality improvement by peer review and change
control by improved visibility. It was written to help manage change in
small teams. Other than the (perceived) cost of performing design and
code reviews, it is very cheap. (In fact, it's so simple, I am almost
embarrassed to write about it.)

<p> The purpose of the framework is to improve the way that you manage
change. It is not to <i>prevent</i> change or creativity, since change
is an essential part of the process of software development.
Ultimately, the framework is about <i>confidence in quality</i>, and
<i>commitment to stability</i>.

<p> It is written with Java in mind, and so emphasizes packages, but
it can probably be applied without much difficulty in other
languages. For more substantial reading (and references) on the
reasons for reviews and change control see Steve McConnell's books
<i>Code Complete</i> or <i>Software Project Survival Guide</i>.

<p>

<a name="rating">
<h2>Rating levels</h2>
</a>

 <P> The most visible part of the framework is a <I>rating</i> that is
assigned to each package or class. The rating levels are <I>red</I>,
<I>yellow</I>, <I>green</I>, or <I>blue</I>. The basic idea is that a
package or class starts at red, and advances up to blue by a
light-weight review process. At each step in the process, the package
or class author proposes an increase in its rating; the chief reviewer
for that package is then responsible for organizing a review, and
advancing the ranking after the issues raised in the review have been
resolved.

<P> Generally, it's easier to rate whole packages. This makes
management easier and provides a form of "micro-milestone" that aids
completion. Sometimes, an individual class will need to have a
different rating than the rest of the package it's in, and this is
fine -- just annotate the source file appropriately.

<p> The meanings of the four rating levels are:

<dl>

<dt><b>Red</b>

<dd>

The package is preliminary.

 <P>This means that we have no confidence in the design or
implementation (if there is one) of this package, and that anyone that
uses it can expect it to change substantially and without notice.

 <P>
<dt><b>Yellow</b>

<dd> The package has passed design review.

 <P> This means that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in the
architecture and design of the package, and that it will not change in
any substantial way. We do expect the API to shift around a little
during the coding process. You can code to this API with the
understanding that updates will be needed as the API settles.

 <P> <dt><b>Green</b>
<dd> The package has passed code review.

 <P> This means that we have high confidence in the correctness and
stability of the API to this package, and that we have reasonable
confidence that there are no major bugs in the implementation.  The
implementation may not yet by complete and there may be performance
work needed but it's usable by "early-access" developers.

 <P> <dt><b>Blue</b>

<dd> The package has passed final review, and will remain
backwards-compatible.

 <P> This means that are confident that the code is of sufficient
quality for public release, and that we have made a final commitment
to maintain backwards-compatibility. In order to make this commitment,
we have what we consider to be a complete test suite, we have
stress-tested the package by using the API in other code, and we have
conducted a final review of all relevant materials (source,
documentation, demos, etc).

</dl>

That's it. Following sections outline a process for using the
rating, how to deal with change, and other things to consider.

<a name="process">
<h2>A suggested process</h2>
</a>

The process suggested here is simple and easy to remember.
For each level except red:

<ol>
<li>The author announces the package ready for review;
<li>The review moderator organizes and moderates the review;
<li>The author responds to the issues raised in the
review, redesigning or reworking as necessary;
<li>The review moderator signs off on the changes, and
announces the new package rating.
</ol>

Piece of cake! I believe that, as a general rule, the process works
better if the author initiates reviews, as the commitment to
passing the review will be higher. It is important that not too much
time pass between the review and the rework, or the author will lose
motivation and the (hastily taken) review notes will start to lose
meaning.

<p>Depending on the project, you may choose to implement specific
requirements for passing a review. Here are some guidelines that
apply to packages.

<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Yellow</b>

<dd>
If a subsystem or package is being reviewed, then the review requires
detailed design and API documentation, including OMT or UML diagrams and
explanatory text. If one or a few classes with well-defined or obvious
roles are being reviewed, then an API specification or javadoc output
is fine.


<dt><b>Green</b>

<dd>
Green is a fairly large jump from yellow. Since a rating of green
means that other developers are going to rely on your code, passing
green requires a test suite that is substantial enough to give
the reviewers confidence that the code really does what it says it
does.

<p> In general, code that relies on other code that is not itself green
should be taken green only with appropriate noting of the dependency
and the need to fix it. For example, if package A uses package B and B
is still Red, then make B at least Yellow before making A Green. The
same principle applies to inheritance hierarchies: a class that
inherits from a Red class cannot be reasonably made Green, since you
can't have any confidence in its stability.


<dt><b>Blue</b>

<dd>
Blue means that the code has been stress-tested in use by other
packages. This requirement improves the chances that a package really
does fulfill its requirements, at least as far as its clients are
concerned. One way to encourage this (suggested by John Davis) is to
require that at least one client package be Green before making a
package Blue.


</dl>

Don't forget that the ratings apply only to individual packages.
Complete system integration and testing is out of the scope of
this guideline.


<a name="change">
<h2>Managing change</h2>
</a>

Change is a fundamental aspect of software development.  Without going
into details of why you might need to make changes, here are some
guidelines as to how to approach making them. If the guidelines for
change at each level cannot be met, then take the package back to a
lower level. This is an action that is acceptable and in some cases
probably inevitable -- but it is a very strong signal that the changes
need to be evaluated very carefully, since the package has reached its
current level by a hopefully careful review process.

<p>
This section outlines the changes allowed by each rating level. If a
change greater than that allowed is required, then the package must be
dropped back a level.  The first step in doing so is to stop and
consider if it really <i>is</i> required. This is not a simple yes-no
question, as it depends on an analysis of the impact of the changes
and probable benefits. In <i>Code Complete</i>, Steve McConnell
suggests a "change committee" be established -- doing so may be a
little heavy for a small team, but the spirit is the same, have
someone else (other than the proposer) and evaluate the change to see if
it really is worth it. If it is, great -- do it.  At least you will
know it's worth the pain!

<p> There is one overriding rule for any changes at all: <i>code
checked into the public repository must not break the
build</i>. Source code changes that break the build check-point
disrupt all work and are unacceptable.

<dl>

<dt><b>Red</b>

<dd>

Changes are expected. If you know that other code already uses red
code (if you have any), then you should at least notify whoever is
responsible for that other code. Demos and test suites might be
examples of code that depends on red code. But other than that, any
changes to red specifications or code are acceptable (with
the exception noted above!).

<p>
<dt><b>Yellow</b>

<dd>

Minor changes to the interface of a yellow package are expected and
acceptable. Major changes -- for example, reworking the collaboration
of some of the classes in the package -- are things that "should" have
been detected in the design review before the package went yellow, and
thus require a re-review.  (If this can't be done immediately, take
the package back to red.)  In any case, major changes to a yellow
package are to be considered with some care. Since the package has
already been reviewed you need good reason to make very
substantial changes.

<p>
Change in the implementation code of a yellow package is expected as
part of the development process.

<p>
<dt><b>Green</b>

<dd>

Changes to the interface of a green package are to be considered very
carefully. A substantial amount of code may already depend on this
interface, and adding new methods is better than changing old ones if
it can be done without destroying the conceptual integrity of the
package.

<p>
Changes to the implementation of green packages are normal and
expected, provided that the semantics behind the interface do not
change. If they do, then take care to ensure that code that depends on
this package will not break or are updated.

<p>
<dt><b>Blue</b>

<dd>
The interface to a blue package must not change in an incompatible
way. Changes that extend the existing interface without changing its
semantics are acceptable, but these changes should themselves be
reviewed in a yellow-green-blue sequence. Implementation code can
change, but this should be done only for bug fixes or for planned
performance enhancements. Any but the simplest fixes should be
reviewed again to maintain confidence in the package.

<p>
A blue package cannot be taken back to a lower level, as doing so
would break the commitment to backward compatibility implied by blue.


</dl>

<p>
There are other ways with dealing with change at more fundamental
levels. Firstly, designing a system with possible or probable change
in mind will make it easier to accommodate large-scale changes with
minimal disruption to existing packages. Consider implementing
wrappers, facades, adapters, or (even) subclasses to deal with change
instead of making major modifications to code that has been thoroughly
reviewed and tested. Remember that a blue package represents a
substantial investment in intellectual effort, not to mention sweat.


<a name="adapting">
<h2>Adapting the method</h2>
</a>

The rating levels and process outlined above are guidelines only.
Modifications can and should be made to account for different
development styles, the purpose and importance of a package, and
other circumstances. Ultimately, the best guideline to give is
that the reviewers use their judgment in applying these guidelines.
These guidelines, I believe, will be most effective if you think
"confidence and commitment," not "rules and regulations."

<dl>
<p>
<dt><B>Documentation</B>

<dd> A package that is undocumented is hard to use. My personal
inclination is to encourage a reasonable level of documentation by i)
expecting a reasonably complete design specification to go to yellow,
ii) expecting substantial embedded documentation (for extraction by
javadoc) to go to green, and iii) <I>requiring</I> complete embedded
documentation and a programmer's guide derived from the specification
to go to blue.

<p>
<dt><B>Specification</B>

<dd> Any specification form that is understandable and maintainable
should be accepted to go to yellow. I prefer not to use documentation
generated from source code as the "specification" as that will change
as the source changes and is hard to recover later.

 <P>Object models, in OMT or UML, should be required for
any design review.

<p>
<dt><B>More levels</B>

<dd> The four levels described here may seem too "far apart" in some
circumstances. In particular, the gap from yellow to green is quite
large, and may take quite a while to cross while the code is in a
state where others need to depend on it but don't have the
"confidence" given by a green rating. Consider introducing sub-levels,
such as "green-alpha" and "green-beta."

<p>
<dt><B>Retrospective application</B>

<dd> Sometimes it may be necessary to consider rating code that is
already considered "done." In this situation, there is little point in
going back and starting from red -- instead, the reviewers must judge
whether a single code review or final review is sufficient for a green
or blue rating.  The key points to remember are <i>confidence</i> and
<I>commitment</I>. Whatever rating you are giving the package, you
need to have the same confidence in and commitment to it as if it had
gone through the entire process.

<p>
<dt><B>Individual files</B>

<dd> It is often not possible to rate a whole package at once, either
because of its size or because some parts of it are poorly-understood
(simply because that's the nature of software development). In the
first case, it is easy enough to break it into parts and have multiple
review meetings. In the second, you should perhaps consider if the
less-well-understood part of the package can be isolated into a
cohesive sub-package -- this sub-package can then be reviewed and
rated independently from the main package.

 <P> In any case, it is perfectly acceptable to rate a package
overall but note exceptions in the package status document.
