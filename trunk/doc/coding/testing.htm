<h1><A NAME="Testing Ptolemy II">Testing Ptolemy II</A></h1>
This page is primarily for Ptolemy II Developers.  Some of the commands
mentioned below are not included in the Ptolemy II distribution.

 <P>Contents:

<LI> <A HREF="#testing java">Testing Java</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#testing documentation">Testing Documentation</A>

<H2><A NAME="test suite">Test Suite</A></H2>

We have included regression tests for most of the Ptolemy II code.  Usually,
wherever there is Java file, the tests are in the <CODE>test</CODE>
directory.

<H3>Running the tests</H3>
The tests themselves are written in Tcl, and use
<a href="../install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a>
which is a 100% Java implementation of a subset of Tcl.
We have included the <a href="tcljava.htm"><CODE>java::</CODE> man page</a>
for use by test suite authors.


 <p>We ship Jacl as a jar file called <CODE>$PTII/lib/ptjacl.jar</CODE>.

 <p><CODE>make tests</CODE> will run the tests in the current directory
and any subdirectories.


<H3>Writing your own tests</H3>

There are two ways to write tests:
<ol>
<li> Use Vergil to create tests using the Test actor
<li> Write tests using Tcl
</ol>

<h4>Using Vergil to write tests</h4>
The testing infrastructure will automatically run an MoML models
located in <CODE>test/auto</CODE> directories.
 <p>The test passes if it does not throw an exception
 <p>The Test actor can be used to compare the first few results
of a simulation with a known good results.  If the comparison fails,
then the test fails.
 <p>If a test is in the optional <CODE>test/auto/failed</CODE> 
directory, then it will be marked as a known failure if it fails.


 <p>Do not use annotations, since these will require vergil to
be present at test time
 <p>Do not use composite actors such as actor/lib/Sinewave.xml that
have annotations.  Instead use
ptolemy.domains.sdf.kernel.test.SinewaveTest

 <p>Using Vergil to write tests is quite a bit easier than writing Tcl
 code, but it is much more difficult to handle corner cases and test
for erroneous conditions by writing models.  Tcl tests are unit tests,
whereas tests that use models are system tests and may mask unit
test bugs.  


<h4>Writing Tcl Tests</h4>

The test suite infrastructure is based on the Tcl test suite code.  The

 <P>The file <A HREF="../../util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl</CODE></A> defines the Tcl proc <CODE>test</CODE>.

 <P><CODE>test</CODE> takes five arguments:
<OL>
<LI> The name of the test, for example: <CODE>foo-1.0</CODE>
  <br> The name of the test should strictly follow the format below.
	The Tcl tests that come with the Tcl distribution follow a similar
	format, so unless there is a strong need to not follow the format,
	please stick with what works.
	<MENU>
	<LI> The first part of
	name of the test should reflect the command that is
	being tested.

	<LI> The test number should be separated by a dash '<CODE>-</CODE>'

	<LI> Each test number consists of a major value and a minor value,
	separated by a dot.  Usually the major value changes as different
	parts of the command are being tested.  The minor value changes
	for different tests for the particular part of the command under test.

	<LI> Test numbers usually start with <CODE>1</CODE>, though if
	you are
	doing setup, you can start with <CODE>0</CODE>.

	<LI> If you go back later and want to stick a test in between
	<CODE>foo-1</CODE> and <CODE>foo-2</CODE>, you can always call
	your new test <CODE>foo-1.1</CODE>
	</MENU>


<LI> The test description, usually a single sentence.

<LI> The contents of the test, usually Tcl code that does the action to
be tested.  The last line of the contents should return a value.

<LI> The results to be compared against.


<li> The last argument is optional and determines what sort of test is
being run.  The default value is <CODE>NORMAL</CODE>, which means that
the test should pass under normal conditions.  If the value is
<CODE>KNOWN_FAILED</CODE>, then the test is expected to fail, but
eventually will be fixed.  By using <CODE>KNOWN_FAILED</CODE>, developers
can mark tests that they know are failing, which will save other
developers from attempting to debug known problems.

</OL>

Below is a sample piece of code that sources the
<CODE>testDefs.tcl</CODE> file and then runs one test.  The code below
has the incorrect value return results to be compared against, so the
test suite properly indicates that the test failed.

<tcl><pre>
if {[string compare test [info procs test]] == 1} then {
    source [file join $PTII util testsuite testDefs.tcl]
} {}
test testExample-1.1 {This is the first test example, it does very little} {
	catch {this is an error} errMsg1
	set a "this is the value of a"
	list $errMsg1 $a
} {{invalid command name "this"} {this is NOT the value of a}}
</pre></tcl>

<H3>Parts of a test file</H3>
Test files should be located in the <CODE>test</CODE> directory.

 <P>It is better to have many small test files as opposed to a few
large test files so that other developers can quickly find the tests
for the class they are working with.  Usually tests for the class
<CODE>Foo</CODE> are found in the file <CODE>test/Foo.tcl</CODE>

 <P>Each test file should have the following parts:
<OL>

<LI> The Copyright

<LI> The code that loads the test system package
<PRE>
if {[string compare test [info procs test]] == 1} then {
    source testDefs.tcl
}
</PRE>
Each directory contains a <CODE>testDefs.tcl</CODE> file which
in turn sources <a href="../../util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl</CODE></a>.  The idea here is that
if the test framework changes, each test file need not be updated.

<LI> A line that the user can uncomment if they want the test system to
produce verbose messages:
<PRE>
#set VERBOSE 1
</PRE>


<LI> The individual tests, which should loosely follow the Ptolemy II
file format standard:
<PRE>
############################################################################
#### Foo
test Foo-1.1 {Test out Foo} {

} {}
</PRE>

</OL>

<H3><A NAME="test styles">Test Styles</A></H3>
There are two types of tests:
<OL>
<LI> Tests that handle all necessary setup in each individual test.

<LI> Tests that rely on the earlier tests to do setup.
</OL>

In general, each test file should be able to be run over and over again
in a binary without exiting the binary (it should be idempotent).

 <P>It is up to the author of the tests as to whether each individual
test does all the set up necessary.  If each test is atomic, then it
makes it easy to highlight the text of an individual test and run it.
If lots of tests are sharing common setup, then using a separate
procedure to do setup might help.  On the negative side, atomic tests
usually are longer and have more complicated return results.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="testing java">Testing Java</A></H2>

Jacl is a 100% Java implementation of a subset of Tcl.
We use Jacl to test Java by writing Tcl code that exercises the Java classes.

<H3>Running the tests</H3>
To run the all the tests, do <CODE>cd $PTII; make tests</CODE>

<p>If you run <CODE>make</CODE> in a test directory that contains
tests written in Tcl for testing Java classes, then the 'right thing'
should just happen.


<H3>Writing Tests for Java </H3>
Below we discuss some of the details of writing tests in Tcl that test
Java classes.
<H4>Simple Example</H4>
<p>Jacl allows us to instantiate objects in a class and call public
methods.  We use Jacl and the standard Tcl test bed to create tests.
In the example below, we call <CODE>java::new</CODE> to create an
instance of the Java <CODE>NamedObj</CODE> class.  We can then
call public methods of <CODE>NamedObj</CODE> by referring to the
Java object handle <CODE>$n</CODE>:
<PRE>
test NamedObj-2.1 {Create a NamedObj, set the name, change it} {
    set n [java::new pt.kernel.NamedObj]
    set result1 [$n getName]
    $n setName "A Named Obj"
    set result2 [$n getName]
    list $result1 $result2
} {{} {A Named Obj}}
</PRE>

<H4>Java Tcl Test Files</H4>
It is best if each Java class has a separate Tcl file that contains tests.
The base of the name of the Tcl test file should be the same of the Java
class being tested.  The Tcl test file should be located in the
<CODE>test</CODE> subdirectory of the directory where the Java class
is defined.
 <P>For example, if we are testing <CODE>NamedObj.java</CODE>, then
the Tcl test file should be at <CODE>test/NamedObj.tcl</CODE>.


<H3><A NAME="JavaScope">JavaScope</A></H3>
We use Sun's
<a href="http://www.sun.com/workshop/testingtools/index.html" target="_top">JavaScope</a> test coverage tool as part of our testing environment.
Unfortunately, on November 5, 1999, Sun decided to discontinue support
of JavaScope.  In the short term, we are continuing to use JavaScope.

 <P>Here's how to review the test suite code coverage:
<OL>

<LI> Run:
<PRE>
cd $PTII/ptolemy/kernel
make jsall
</PRE>
The <CODE>jsall</CODE> makefile rule does the following:
<MENU>
<LI> JavaScope uses a program called <CODE>jsinstr</CODE>
to instrument the Java files.  <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> copies the
original files to the <CODE>jsoriginal</CODE> directory and then
adds Java function calls to copies of the files.  These function calls
increment counters in a database at runtime.

<LI> To compile the instrumented classes the <CODE>JavaScope.zip</CODE> file
is added to the CLASSPATH and then the classes are recompiled.

<LI> The test suite is run.
</MENU>

<LI> To views the code coverage run either <CODE>jsreport</CODE>,
<CODE>jssummary</CODE> or <CODE>javascope</CODE>:
<pre>
jssummary -HTML -PROGRESS -OUTFILE=/tmp/summary
jsreport -HTML -PROGRESS -RECURSIVE -OUTDIR=/tmp/report
</pre>

<LI> To restore the files
back to the original state, run <CODE>make jsrestore</CODE>.
<PRE>
make jsrestore
</PRE>

</OL>
<H4>JavaScope Details</H4>
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> saves the original Java files to the
<CODE>jsoriginal</CODE> directory.  The <CODE>jsall</CODE> makefile
rule checks to see if this directory is present, and if it is not, runs
<CODE>jsinstr</CODE>.  The <CODE>jsrestore</CODE> rule runs
<CODE>jsrestore</CODE> and then attempts to remove the <CODE>jsoriginal</CODE>
directory so that the next run of the <CODE>jsall</CODE> rule will
recreate it.  If you are running <CODE>jsinstr</CODE> by hand on files
that are not in the makefile, then you may find it necessary clean out the
<CODE>jsoriginal</CODE> directory with:
<PRE>
jsrestore *.java
rm jsoriginal/README
rmdir jsoriginal
</PRE>


<LI> Javascript writes the code coverage information to
<CODE>~/jsdatabase</CODE>.  You might find it helpful to remove
this directory periodically.

</MENU>


<H4>Flushing the JavaScope database</H4>
The JavaScope database must be flushed by hand at the end of a run, or the
code coverage data of the run will not be dumped out to disk.
 <P>There are two ways to do this.
<OL>

<LI> The <CODE>IFLUSHCLASS</CODE> option will flush out the coverage
information for the current class at the end of each method.

<LI> The <CODE>IFLUSH</CODE> option will flush out all the coverage
information at the end of each method.

</OL>
Obviously, using <CODE>IFLUSH</CODE> will take more time than using
<CODE>IFLUSHCLASS</CODE>.

 <P>The <CODE>jsintr</CODE> options are set by consulting the following
resources in order.
<OL>
<LI> system properties - environment variables

<LI> <CODE>$HOME/javascope.properties</CODE>

<LI> <CODE>./javascope.properties</CODE> in the current directory.

<LI> Options can be embedded in files as comments:
<PRE>
/*jsoptions: ...*/
</PRE>
Embedded comment options can be set more than once in a file.  Embedded
comment options are in effect until is the option is changed by another
embedded comment option.

<LI>  Command line arguments to <CODE>jsinstr</CODE>.

</OL>


 <p>The <CODE>doneTests</CODE> proc of
<a href="../../util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/testDefs.tcl</CODE></a>
includes a call that will flush the database:
<pre>
    catch {java::call COM.sun.suntest.javascope.database.js\$ flush}
</pre>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="testing documentation">Testing Documentation</A></H2>

The Ptolemy II documentation is written in HTML.  There are several tools
that can be used.
<H3>weblint</H3>

Weblint tells the user about html errors.  Weblint can be obtained
from <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint.tar.gz"><CODE>ftp://ftp.cre.canon.co.uk/pub/weblint/weblint.tar.gz</CODE></A>
To run <CODE>weblint</CODE>:
<PRE>
cd $PTII
make weblint
</PRE>

<H3>htmlchek</H3>

Htmlchek is another tool that tells the user about html errors.
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> also checks for bad links.  The
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> output is a little hard to read, so we tend to
use <CODE>weblint</CODE> for checking individual files.
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> can be obtained from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/htmlchek/"><CODE>ftp://ftp.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/htmlchek/</CODE></A>

<P> The best way to run <CODE>htmlchek</CODE> is to create a sample
distribution, create the files in the <CODE>codeDoc</CODE> directory
and then run <CODE>htmlchek</CODE>

<OL>
<LI> Create the test distribution:
<PRE>
cd /users/ptII/adm/gen-latest; make htmlchek
</PRE>

<LI> Reset <CODE>PTII</CODE> to point to the test distribution:
<PRE>
setenv PTII /users/ptII/adm/dists/ptII-latest
cd PTII
</PRE>

<LI> Run <CODE>make install</CODE>.  This will make the Itcl HTML docs
twice, which will populate the <CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> directories.
You need to make the Itcl HTML docs twice so that the cross references are
correct.

<LI> Run <CODE>make htmlchek</CODE>

</OL>



The output ends up in five files
<MENU>
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.ERR</CODE> - HTML usage errors
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.NAME</CODE> - Locations in the specified files
that ware not referenced by any of those files
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> - References from the specified files
that are not found in the files.  This file is by far the most important
file to look at.
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.SRC</CODE> - References to online images.
<LI> <CODE>htmlchekout.MAP</CODE> - Cross dependency information.
</MENU>

<P> All of the references in <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> that point
to <CODE>.html</CODE> files should be checked.  References to non-HTML
files appear in <CODE>htmlchekout.HREF</CODE> because the non-HTML
files were not included in the list of files that
<CODE>htmlchek</CODE> ran on.  One quick way to search all the the <CODE>*.html</CODE> files is
<PRE>
cd $PTII
grep mystring `find . -name "*.html" -print`
</PRE>

<H3>Spell checking</H3>
<a href="../../util/testsuite/ptspell"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/ptspell</CODE></a>
 is a Ptolemy II specific spelling checker.

<CODE>ptspell</CODE> has the following features:
<menu>
<li> It uses
<a href="../../util/testsuite/ptlocaldict"><CODE>$PTII/util/testsuite/ptlocaldict</CODE></a>
as a local dictionary of acceptable words that are not in the
regular system dictionary. <CODE>ptlocaldict</CODE>
is kept in ASCII sort order.

<li> <CODE>ptspell</CODE> splits words up that contain embedded
capital letters and then runs spell again.  Thus, <CODE>ptspell</CODE>
can report spelling problems in variable, method and class names.
This mechanism also reduces the number of words that are reported as
misspelled because the word consists of two words stuck together.

<li> If <CODE>/usr/local/bin/ispell</CODE> is present, then
it will use it.  If you are running under Windows with Cygwin, you can
download a prebuilt version of <CODE>ispell</CODE> from
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/tychoTools.htm"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/tycho/tychoTools.htm</CODE></a>

</menu>

 <p>
Checking the spelling in all the HTML files can be done with:
<PRE>
cd $PTII
ptspell `find . -name "*.html" -print`
</PRE>

<H3>Check the distribution for bogus files</H3>
Run the following makefile rules and commands:
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>make realclean</CODE>

<DD> This will remove the <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files and the files in
<CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE>.  The reason to remove the
<CODE>codeDoc</CODE> files is so that we don't ship HTML files for any
classes that have been removed.

<DT> <CODE>make install</CODE>
<DD> This will recreate the <CODE>tclIndex</CODE> files and the
<CODE>doc/codeDoc</CODE> files.

<DT> <CODE>make checkjunk</CODE>
<DD> Look for files in the distribution that should not be there.

<DT> <CODE>adm/bin/chkgifs</CODE>
<DD> This file looks for gif files that are not used by HTML files
in the distribution.
