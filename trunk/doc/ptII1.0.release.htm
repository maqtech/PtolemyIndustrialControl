<h1>Ptolemy II version 1.0 Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II version 1.0 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>This release is meant for programmers already familiar with Java.

 <p>Ptolemy II 1.0 includes applet demonstrations of the domains, but
it does not include a GUI.

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy 1.0, it can be found
in <a href="design/toc.htm" target="contents">$PTII/doc/design</a>.

The most recent copy of the Ptolemy II design document can be
found online at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html</CODE></a>


<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 1.0 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.1.  (Note that the GUI shipped with the next
release (Ptolemy II 1.0) will use Tcl/Tk and Itcl,
so it will not be 100% Java).

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 1.0 under Solaris 2.5.1 and NT4.0sp3 
with JDK1.1.6.

 <p>Ptolemy II can be built under JDK1.2, though we have not thoroughly
tested Ptolemy II under JDK1.2.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#tclblend">Tcl Blend</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite 

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<menu>

<li> Ptolemy II version 1.0 does not include a GUI.

<li> The <CODE>ptolemy.kernel.event</CODE> package is likely to
change substantially.
