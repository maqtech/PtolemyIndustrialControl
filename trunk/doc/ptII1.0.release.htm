<h1>Ptolemy II 1.0 Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II 1.0 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>Ptolemy II 1.0 includes Vergil, a graphical user interface for
developing models. 

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy II 1.0, it can be found
in <a href="design/toc.htm" target="toc">$PTII/doc/design</a>.

The most recent copy of the Ptolemy II design document can be
found online at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/doc/design.html</CODE></a>


<h2>Major Features that are new in Ptolemy 1.0 </h2>
<menu>

<li> Vergil - the Ptolemy II GUI
(Steve Neuendorffer and Edward A. Lee)

<li> CORBA/Jini work
<li> Giotto Domain

<li> GR Domain

<li> DT Domain

<li> Code Generation of SDF models
(Jeff Tsay and Christopher Hylands)

</menu>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 1.0 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.2 or JDK1.3

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 1.0 under Solaris 2.5.1 and Windows 2000 sr1
and with JDK1.2.2 and JDK1.3.0. 

<p> Ptolemy II 1.0 will not compile under JDK1.1.x.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<menu>

<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from <a
href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu</CODE></a>.

<li> Ptolemy II 1.0 does not include a GUI.

<li> This is the first release of the Finite State Machine domain (FSM)
which has the following limitations
	<menu>
	<li> The FSM design document chapter is not part of the 1.0 beta
	<li> There are not very many tests for FSM
	<li> MoML support for FSM models is incomplete.
	</menu>


<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

<li> The import statement in MoML requires the base attribute.
The following will not work:
<pre>
&lt;import source="testClass2.xml"/&gt;
</pre>
Use the following instead
<pre>
&lt;import base="../../.." source="ptolemy/moml/test/testClass2.xml"/&gt;
</pre>
<li> The JDK1.2.1 Plug-in has a bug that causes the Netscape or Iexplorer
process to linger after exiting.  The workaround is to turn of the JIT
using the Java Plug-in Control Panel, see the <a href="troubleshooting.htm#jit">Troubleshooting guide</a> for details.
This bug may be fixed in JDK1.2.2.
