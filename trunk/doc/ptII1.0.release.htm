Ptolemy II 1.0 is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes
and the Ptolemy II design document

 <p>Ptolemy II 1.0 includes Vergil, a graphical user interface for
developing models. 

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.

<p> The Ptolemy design document is shipped with Ptolemy II 1.0, it can be found

<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 1.0 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.2 or JDK1.3

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 1.0 under Solaris 2.5.1 and Windows 2000 sr1
and with JDK1.2.2 and JDK1.3.0. 

<p> Ptolemy II 1.0 will not compile under JDK1.1.x.

 <p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite

<h2>Limitations</h2>
Version 1.0 has a number of limitations.
<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<menu>
<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from <a
href="ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu"><CODE>ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu</CODE></a>.
</menu>


<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<menu>
<li>The actor library is far from complete.
<li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
expressions of double-valued inputs.

<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

</menu>

<h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>
Version 1.0 of Ptolemy II includes the first graphical user
interface for Ptolemy II.  This UI still has a number of limitations.
<menu>
<li>No undo mechanism.
<li>No way to set the name of ports, relations, or entities.
<li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
<li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.
<li>No mechanism to create a port in an atomic actor.
<li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
<li>No snap-to-grid.
<li>No icon editor.
</menu>

<h3>Missing Domains</h3>
<menu>
<li>Synchronous/reactive.
<li>Boolean and integer dataflow.
<li>Dynamic dataflow
</menu>
