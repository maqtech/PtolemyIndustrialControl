<h1>Ptolemy II 1.0beta Release Notes</h1>
Ptolemy II 1.0beta is a release of the Ptolemy II Java classes.
<!-- and the Ptolemy II design document>

 <p>Ptolemy II 1.0beta includes Vergil, a graphical user interface for
developing models.

 <p>The design document describes the Ptolemy II design and the implementation
of the Java classes.  The design document is not included
with Ptolemy II 1.0beta, but will be shipped with the Ptolemy II 1.0
production release.   In the interim, please see the "Using Vergil"
chapter (<a href="design/usingVergil.pdf">PDF</a> - 
<a href="design/usingVergil/index.htm">HTML</a>)

<h2>Platforms</h2>

The core of Ptolemy II 1.0 is 100% Java, so it should work on any
platform that has JDK1.3

 <p>We developed Ptolemy II 1.0 under Solaris 2.5.1 and Windows 2000 sr1
and with JDK1.2.2 and JDK1.3.0.
We recommend JDK1.3 over JDK1.2.2.  If you have problems with under
JDK1.2.2, please upgrade to JDK1.3

<p> Ptolemy II 1.0 will not compile under JDK1.1.x.

<p>See the <a href="install.htm#Jacl">Jacl</a> section of
the installation page for information about the Ptolemy II test suite

<p>Ptolemy II is available in two versions
   <menu>
   <li> Ptiny - which can be used to build models in 
   CT, DE, FSM, PN and SDF using built-in actors.
   <li> Full - which includes other domains and 
   support for developing custom actors.
   </menu>

<!--vergilDocs-->
<h2>Limitations</h2>
Version 1.0 has a number of limitations.
<h3>Release Limitations</h3>
<menu>
<li> The gzipped tar file that contains the Ptolemy II distribution
 <B>requires</B> GNU tar or WinZip.  Solaris 2.5.1 tar will fail to
untar this file with a checksum error because the pathnames are longer
than 100 characters.  If you do not have GNU tar, you can obtain
source and selected binaries from 
ftp://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/pub/gnu.
</menu>


<h3>Limitations in the Actor Libraries</h3>
<menu>
<li>The actor library is far from complete.
<li>The Expression actor does not properly propagate type constraints in
an expression-dependent fashion. It works correctly for double-valued
expressions of double-valued inputs.

<li> The readFile() parameter function does not work with applets.

</menu>

<h3>Limitations in the PN Domain</h3>
The PN domain documents that it locally handles mutations.  However, this
is currently not true in the implementation.  For the basic PN model, this
doesn't really matter, since mutations happen pretty much the same as they
would otherwise.  (i.e. they are non-deterministic in when they execute) 
However, for timed PN models, there is actually some expressiveness
lost, since timed PN models can locally execute mutations deterministically.

<h3>Limitations in the FSM Domain</h3>

The FSM domain is still fairly preliminary, and is likely to change
rapidly in future releases.  At this time, it is difficult to build
nontrivial FSM models using Vergil.  Hierarchical models are particularly
difficult to build, and will be handled quite differently in the next
version.  We cannot assure that FSM models that are constructed with
this release will work with future releases.

<h3>Limitations in the SDF Domain</h3>
There are currently two bugs in the SDF Domain.  Both are bugs in the scheduler that can be fairly easily avoided.
<menu>
<li> Opaque tunneling entities result in a NullPointerException.  An Opaque tunneling entity is one that does not have any entities.  It only contains relations between external ports.
<br> <b>Workaround:</b> Do not use a director for tunneling entities.

<li> The SDF scheduler reports that actors are disconnected, when they are connected through external ports.
<br> <b>Workaround:</b> Connect the actors in another way.  This is usually possible when the connection is through an output port (since sources have trigger inputs that are usually disconnected in SDF), but somewhat more difficult when the connection is only through an input port.
</menu>

<h3>Limitations in the User Interface</h3>
Version 1.0 of Ptolemy II includes the first graphical user
interface for Ptolemy II.  This UI is preliminary, and is made
up mostly of code that is rated "red", meaning that both the APIs
and the implementations are likely to change.
There are quite a few limitations.
<menu>
<li>No undo mechanism.
<li>Incomplete printing support.
<li>Weak support for multiports in the graph editor.
<li>It is difficult to control wire routing.
<li>Cannot have more than one vertex in a connection.
<li>No mechanism to set the width of a relation.
<li>The integrated web browser is not a full-featured browser.
<li>No snap-to-grid.
<li>Icon editor not yet integrated.
<li>Debugger not yet integrated.
<li>FSM editor is not yet useful.
<li>It is difficult to add actors to the libraries.
<li>No dynamic class loading.
</menu>

<h3>Missing Domains</h3>
<menu>
<li>Synchronous/reactive.
<li>Boolean and integer dataflow.
<li>Dynamic dataflow
</menu>
