<h1>The Ptolemy Project</h1>
<p>
Ptolemy II is a software framework developed as part of the Ptolemy project.
It is a Java-based component assembly framework with a graphical
user interface called Vergil.  Vergil itself is a component assembly
defined in Ptolemy II.
</p>
<p>
The Ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of
concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. The focus is on assembly of
concurrent components. The key underlying principle in the project is
the use of well-defined <i>models of computation</i> that govern the
interactions between components. A major problem area being addressed is
the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation.
</p>
</table>
<p>
Ptolemy II includes a growing suite of <i>domains</i>, each of which
realizes a model of computation.  It also includes a component library,
in which most components are <i>domain polymorphic</i>, in that they
can operate in several of the domains.  Most are also <i>data polymorphic</i>,
in that they operate on several data types.  The key features
of Ptolemy II are:
<ul>
<li> a modular and extensible user interface infrastructure;
<li> a sophisticated type system;
<li> an XML persistent file format called MoML;
<li> network integration, including support for applets;
<li> a flexible signal plotter;
<li> 3-D graphics animation infrastructure;
<li> a finite-state machine domain providing modal models;
<li> several concurrent domains, including:
<ul>
<li> communicating sequential processes,
<li> continuous-time modeling,
<li> discrete-event modeling (including a distributed version),
<li> discrete-time,
<li> periodic time-driven (giotto),
<li> synchronous-reactive for graphics (gr),
<li> process networks,
<li> and synchronous dataflow.
