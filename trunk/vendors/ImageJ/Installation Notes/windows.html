Windows Installation
</b></font>
<p>
These notes apply to ImageJ 1.32 and later, which is distributed as a Windows installer.
The notes for earlier versions distribued as a ZIP archive are available at
<a href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/windows2.html">rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/windows2.html</a>
<p>


<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Requirements</b></font><br>
ImageJ requires Windows 95 or later. It runs on a machine with 64MB but it runs 
better with 256MB or more, particularly when working with large images and/or stacks. 
<p>



<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Memory</b></font><br>
Use the 
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/edit.html#memory"><i>Edit/Options/Memory</i></a>
command to make more than 128MB available to ImageJ.
Note that setting the "Maximum Memory" value to more than about 75% of real 
RAM may result in poor perfomance due to virtual memory "thrashing". 
The maximum amount of memory that can be allocated is about 1.7 GB.<br>
<p>


With ImageJ 1.32 or later, use the 
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/edit.html#memory"><i>Edit/Options/Memory</i></a>
command to make more than 192MB of memory available to ImageJ.
Setting the "Maximum Memory" value to more than about 75% of real RAM may result in poor perfomance due to virtual memory "thrashing". 
The maximum amount of memory that can be allocated is about 1.8 GB.

<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Upgrading</b></font><br>
To upgrade to the latest version of ImageJ, replace the ij.jar file in the ImageJ folder with a newer one from <A HREF="../../upgrade/index.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/upgrade/</A>.
<p>


<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Drag and Drop</b></font><br>
The Windows version of ImageJ opens images, text files, ROIs and LUTs dropped 
on the title bar or menu bar of the "ImageJ" window. On Windows 2000/XP, it opens files dropped on the
ImageJ shortcut, but another copy of ImageJ is launched if ImageJ is already running.
<p>


<a name=bugs>
<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Known Problems</b></font><br>

<ol>

	<li> Java 1.4.2 crashes when running ImageJ. This bug
	has been reported to Sun and is fixed in the Java 1.5 beta.
	 
	<li> ImageJ cannot use more than about 1.7GB of memory, regardless of how much
	RAM is installed.

	<li> With Java 1.5, <i>Edit/Paste</i> does not work correctly in the text editor.
	ImageJ 1.33k has a work around for the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+V).

	<li> With Java 1.5, <i>File/Print</i> causes ImageJ to crash.

	<li> With Java 1.3.1, <i>File/Print</i> does not correctly print large line drawings 
	(e.g., the plots generated by <i>Analyze/Gels/Plot lanes</i>).
	
	<li> The text cursor is sometimes used instead of the cross hair.
	As a work around, check "Use Pointer Cursor" in <i>Edit/Options/Misc</i>
	or change the Windows XP cursor scheme in Control Panel/Mouse/Pointers to
	"(None)".

</ol>

<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>About the Installer</b></font><br>
The ImageJ Windows installer is created using the 
<A HREF="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</A> installer generator. Image.exe
is a renamed copy of the 
<A HREF="http://www.rolemaker.dk/nonRoleMaker/javalauncher/marner_java_launcher.htm">Marner Java Launcher</A>.
<p>

<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Adding a JAR File</b></font><br>
Some plugins require adding a JAR file to ImageJ. In ImageJ 1.31 or later, this is done by copying 
the JAR file into the plugins folder or an immediate subfolder of the plugins folder, then restarting
ImageJ. To compile a plugin that uses a JAR file, copy the JAR file to the Java extensions folder, ImageJ\jre\lib\ext.

<a name=java14>
<font color="#224488" face="Helvetica, Arial" size = +1><b>Using ImageJ with Java 1.5 (5.0)</b></font><br>
<ol>
	<li>Install the J2SE 5.0 JDK at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">java.sun.com/j2se/</a>. (Do not
	install Java 1.4.2. It has a bug that causes ImageJ to crash when you use the Measure command.)
	<li> Open the ImageJ folder and Create a copy of ImageJ.exe by right-clicking on it, dragging, and selecting "Copy Here" 
	from the popup menu. Rename the copy something like "ImageJ15.exe".
	<li> Create a copy of ImageJ.cfg by right-clicking on it, dragging, and selecting "Copy Here" 
	from the popup menu. Rename the copy something like "ImageJ15.cfg".
	<li> Open Image15.cfg in a text editor such as Notepad and edit the second line so it looks
	something like
    <p><font size=-1>
        &nbsp;  &nbsp;C:\sdk1.5\bin\javaw.exe
    </font><p>
    where C:\sdk1.5 is the directory where you installed Java 1.5.
    <li> Copy (not move) tools.jar from C:\sdk1.5\lib to C:\sdk1.5\jre\lib\ext. (This is
    needed for the "Compile and Run" command to work.)
    <li> Run ImageJ using Java 1.5 by double-clicking on "ImageJ15".
    </ol>
