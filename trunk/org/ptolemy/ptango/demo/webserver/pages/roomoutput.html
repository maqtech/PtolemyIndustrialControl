		 Use online version to avoid problems rendering icons.  The files are 
		 included in the repository for reference.  The local version could be used
		 so that an internet connection is not required if testing from localhost.
		 Both the human-readable version and the .min.js version for smaller 
		 footprint are in the repository, though the web app only needs one version 
		 to run.
		 Note that jQuery 1.7 is available, but there are currently problems with
