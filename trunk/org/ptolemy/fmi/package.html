A Java interface to Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) files.

<p>A Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) is a file that contains functionality that may
be invoked either via co-simulation or model exchange.  Typically, a FMU file has
a <code>.fmu</code> extension.  A FMU file is a zip file that contains a file
named <code>modelDescription.xml</code> and one or more platform-dependent 
shared libraries.</p>

<p> In FMI-1.0, co-simulation fmu files contain a modelDescription.xml
file that has an &lt;Implementation&gt; element.  Model exchange fmu
files do not have this element.</p>

<p>See FMUCoSimulation.java and FMUModelExchange.java for simple examples
that read in .fmu files and invoke methods in the the platform-dependent
shared libraries.</p>

<p>Sample .fmu files may be found in fmu/cs and fmu/me.  These files were
generated using a port of the FMUSDK which may be found at
