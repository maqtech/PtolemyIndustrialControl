# If this file is named "ptII.properties", don't edit it!
# Instead edit ptII.properties.in and run "cd $PTII;./configure"
# configure reads in $PTII/lib/ptII.properties.in,
# substitutes in variables that are surrounded with @,
# and generated $PTII/lib/ptII.properties.in
#
# We use a properties file here so that we can easily start Ptolemy II
# without passing lots of command line arguments
