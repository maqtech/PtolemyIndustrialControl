Subject: Boeing's New Technology Information Distribution System
Cc: newton@coe.berkeley.edu


Department Chairs and Boeing PIs:


To enhance its ability to learn of important and relevant research to
its business model, Boeing has established a Web-interface
distribution system that allows faculty to widely disseminate
information within Boeing.  The System can be assessed through
http://www.Boeing.com/edu.  Additional information is contained in the
message below, provided by Luis Figueroa, Boeing's executive liaison
to the Berkeley campus.

Faculty/ Professors:
??DO YOU WANT THE INFORMATION, IDEAS, AND INNOVATION YOU GENERATE BE
REVIEWED BY BOEING ENGINEERS??
In the past, you relied upon one or two points of contact at Boeing to
rout your information, ideas, and/or innovation to others that might
be
interested. OR you didn't bother to try to get any information to
Boeing
and hoped that they would find out about your Great work by word of
mouth.
The TIDS (Technology Information Distribution System) is a list server
that
routes YOUR information to specific engineers across Boeing that have
interest in the technological areas. Currently, this number can be as
high
as 8000+ and growing each day. Which approach would you think higher
result
of relationship and partnership building could occur??
TIDS is easy to use and "Pushes" YOUR information onto the desktops of
Boeing Engineers ACROSS the country to include all of our Senior
Technology
Fellows, our Phantom Works Engineers, our Leading Technology Managers,
many
of our User Engineering groups(i.e. F-15, Space Station, 777 Group,
Sonic
Cruiser, etc), Executive Leaders who are alumni of your University,
etc.
??DO YOU WANT TO RECEIVE "NEEDS" REQUEST FROM BOEING ENGINEERS??
By "subscribing" to the various technology groups(as many as your
desire), YOU can receive information request from the Engineering
Groups at
Boeing. Faculty, and Research Professors at various Universities have
asked, "How do I find out what the Boeing Engineer need so I can
respond??"
TIDS will allow the Boeing engineer to put his/her needs, questions,
request
for information, etc on the web AND it will be automatically be sent
to you.
If you have interest, solutions, ideas, etc, YOU can respond directly
to the
Engineer.
??HOW DO I INPUT "NEWS" OR "SUBSCRIBE TO NEEDS"??
Go to
http://www.Boeing.com/edu
and complete the SIMPLE information. The ID and PASSWORD are the same
-
school .
Remember, to build a relationship with Boeing or any other parties,
the key
is INTENSITY OF MESSAGE * FREQUENCY OF INTERACTION. Thus, please input
NEWS
that is "Catchy" to an Engineer AND submit follow-ups or new inputs
often.
The interest and relationship and finally Partnership will grow with
time.
Looking forward to seeing your team on TIDS.
