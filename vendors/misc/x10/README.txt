This directory is for interface libraries for x10.
To download them, go to:
   http://x10.homelinux.org/download.html
and download tjx10p-12.zip. (Version 1.2) Unzip this file 
in this directory ($PTII/vendors/misc/x10/)
and rerun configure.

The configure script looks for the library at
$PTII/vendors/misc/x10/tjx10p-12/lib/x10.jar
and
$PTII/vendors/misc/x10/tjx10p-11/lib/x10.jar

Note that this library also requires javax.comm be installed to work properly.
