Changes to BYACC/J 0.93 (Bob Jamison)

These changes are specific to Java parser generation (C parser code
remains the same)

1) Parser values need to be cloned. Added a clone() method to the 
   parser value class, and added a call the clone() method in the
   parser class.
2) Parser tables are written to ASCII .tbl files instead of inlined 
   in the parser class code. The reason for this is the 64KB limit
   on the size of .class files in Java. If .tbl files exist, the 
   generated parser reads them and writes platform-independent 
   binary .bin files, if the previous .bin files are older than the
   .tbl files or no .bin files are found.
3) Added the -p option to set the package of the parser and parser  
   value classes. Example: 

   yacc -j -p ptolemy.lang.java -f JavaParser jparser.y
 
   where jparser.y is the definition file.

4) If yydebug is set and yyrule.tbl is not present then
   you will get a NullPointerException because a debug() call
   dereferences yyrule[], which is null. (cxh)

5) New instances of parserval are created for the return value of",
   each rule, so that assignments to the fields of parserval do not",
   corrupt previous data.",

(If you modify the sources, be sure to update skeleton.c)
