A Java interface to Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) files.

<p>A Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) is a file that contains functionality that may
be invoked either via co-simulation or model exchange.  Typically, a FMU file has
a <code>.fmu</code> extension.  A FMU file is a zip file that contains a file
named <code>modelDescription.xml</code> and one or more platform-dependent 
shared libraries.</p>
