An Java interface to the Global Data Plane.
<p>"The Global Data Plane provides a data-centric glue for swarm applications.  The basic primitive is that of a multi-input, multi-output, time-aware secure log.  Data inputs are timestamped and rearranged by timestamp. Data can be securely commited to the log in a variety of ways, including via a external consistent transactional model.  Data within the log can be randomly read, thereby permitting a variety of data models, including (eventually) a SQL query model.  Further, data within a log can be preserved for the long term."
